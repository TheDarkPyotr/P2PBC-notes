# Tokenization
Tokens are *coin-like* objets generalli lacking a legal framework: they are issued by a private entity for a specific use. The value of those tokens may be high but only within the community that makes use of them. 
There are two main types of tokens:
- **Fungible**
- **Non-fungible (NFT)**

The *fungibility* of a token can be defined as *"being freely exchangeable or replaceable, in whole or in part, for another of like nature or kind"*. This implies main properties like:
- **Interchangeability**: each token is interchangeable with other tokens of its same kind but there aren't defined features of that specific token. 
- **Merging**: can merge unit of fungible asse to get a higher value in quantity
- **Divisibility**: can sen or receive a fraction of a token

Differently, a **non-fungible** item is when two items may look identical at a glance but each will have *unique information or attributes* that makes them irreplaceable or impossible to swap. They are usually charaterized by *scarcity* and *originality*. In the category of *NFT* there is a sub-category for **collectibles** that can include *real-world collectible* (*like Pokemon trading card*). 

In the area of **Fungible tokens** we can identify two differen types:
- **Utility token**: application token or user tokens offered by a company giving future access to products or services. They are not an investment but better as a coupon.
- **Security token**: as an hybrid between shares of a company and cryptocurrency. Gives the owner tights and obligation with voting rights and dividends, thus companies sell shares in form of cryptographic token.

The advantages of *security tokens* are that the voting rights are realted to the amount of tokens owned: they can be offered throigh an *ICO - Initial Coin Offer*. 
The advantages of *utility tokens* are evident when a company want to obtain financing for a project: it can create a *coupon* that can be redeemed in the future for access to its services.

### ICO - Initial Coin Offer
An ICO is basically a cryptocurrency version of a crowdfunding campaign. The developer issue a *limited amount* of tokens, ensuring that the token itself have a value and the ICO has a goal to aim for. The price can be statically *pre-determined* or may increase or decrease depending on how the crowd sale is going. The buying process follows those steps:
- if someone wants to buy the tokens they send a particular amount of Ether to the crowd-sale address. 
- when the contract acknowledges that this transaction is done, they receive their corresponding amount of tokens. 
- ICO is successful if it is really well-distributed and a majority of its tokens is not owned by one entity

Despite the term **fungible token** and **currency** are used interchangeably, the technology is different because the first are usually implemented on the blockchain of the second one. 

#### Semi-fungible token (SFT)
Alonside the *fungible* and *non-fungible (NFT)* tokens, a third type is  known as **Semi-fungible Token (SFT)**: it can *change* the state from being *fungible* to *non-fungible*. 
An example is represented by a *ticket* for the final football championship match:
- interchangeable for any other ticket of the same match, and same seating class 
- after the match is over, can no longer be used for entering to the stadium 
- may become a collector’s item for fans with a different value assigned to it.

## ERC Tokens
*ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments* standard define smart contract that have:
- a **pre-established standard structure** for storing and managing tokens 
- a set of **pre-defined functions** that can be executed on the token 
- give developers the guarantee that assets will behave in a specific way and describe exactly how to interact with the basic functionality of the assets.
The most widespread standard is **ERC-20**, now used as standard for *Fungible tokens (FTs)*, while the **ERC-721** is used for *NFTs* and **ERC-1155** is for semi-fungible tokens.
Those three standard define different way of mapping addresses to data it represent:
- ERC 20 maps `addresses` to `amount`
- ERC 721 maps unique `IDs` to `owners`
- ERC1155 has a nested mapping of `ID` to `owners` to `amount`

The **ERC-20 tokens** allows to implement a **sub-accounting system parallel to the Ethereum** main ledger, having their own unit of account.  There is no mixing with the Ether balances of the addresses while, at the same time, guarantees the transparency, traceability and security provided by the main Ethereum network.

A ***token contract*** contains a map of account addresses and their **balance**: the concept of balance may vary depends from the token contract (*it may represent an amount of object, right, monetary values, etc*). 

The ***mandatory functions*** the standard define are 
- `totalSupply`: returns the total units of tokens that currently exist in the token smart contract
- `balanceOf`: given an address (*user*) returns the token balance of that address
- `transfer()`: given ana ddress and amount, trasnfer the tokens to that address from the balance of the address that executes the transfer. It's a **single-step transaction**: just like a conventional crypto transaction between two wallets.
- `transferFrom()`: allows to transfer tokens from an address that is not that you own 
- `approve`: it's used in tandem with `transferFrom` function, allowing the owner to approves a delegate address to withdraw tokens to trasnfer to other account. It define also the **maximum amount of allowed token** to trasnfer. 
- `allowance`: implement a **two-step payment process**, allowing a third party to carry out a transaction of token on your behalf. It's used for cyclic payments (*like subscription*). It checks also the current *approved number of tokens by an owner to that specific delegate* (*the max setted by `approve` function*).
while the ***optional fields*** defined are:
- `name`: return human readable name of the token
- `symbol`: human-readable symbol for the token
- `decimal`: number of digits (*up to 18*) that come after the decimal place, when displying values on the screen. If the decimal is $2$, the token amount is divided by $100$ to get its visual representation. This field is required because Ethereum does not work with decimal number but only integers.

##### Allowance example
Consider user `A`  with 100 tokens and `B`: `A` want to give permission to `B` to spend all $100$ tokens, so:
1. `A` calls `approve(address(B), 100)`
2. `B` checks how many tokens `A` gave him permission to use by calling `allowance(address(A), address(B)`
3. `B` sends to his account some of these tokens by calling `trasnferFrom(address(A), Address(B), 50)`
in subsequent withdrawals, `B` can finish withdrawing the rest of the funds, but he can only go up to $100$ tokens. 


## ERC-721 Interface
As mentioned, the **ERC-721** is the Ethereum token standard for *NFTs* on the Ethereum blockchain. The *main functions* to be implemented are:
- `ownerOf(ID)`: each ERC721 token is referenced on the blockchain via a unique `ID`. It return the owner's address.
- `transferFrom`: transfer ownership of an NFT. The caller is responsible to confirm that the receiver is capable of receiving the NFTs, otherwise they are **permanently lost**.
- `approve`: approves, or grants, another entity permission to transfer one of the tokens on the owner’s behalf
- `SetApprovealForAll`: enable or disable approval for a third party to manage all the assets of the user (address) while executes this command
- `SafeTransfer`: transfer the ownership of a NFT from one address to another address
- `TransferFrom`: transfers ownership of an NFT, under the hypothesis the receiver is capable of receive NFTs.

Other information defined in a NFT contract are `name`, used to indicate the name of the token to external contracts and `symbol` that provides a token's shorthand name.
Other token-specific information can be associated to an NFT by using the ***metadata*** section that provide nformation for a specific token `ID`. The metadata section can contains *image, description, preview content, traits, unlockable content, supply, royalty etc*. 

The **ongoing royalties** metadata, if setted, when the NFT is sold in the future, allows a certain percentage to go back to the original creator automatically. The creator is able to indicate the address to which the royalties will be sent,
The **unlockable content** metadata contains content that only the owner of the NFT can see or access.

##### Storing metadata
It's possible to store the metadata in the smart contract, thus **on-chain data** or host it separately, obtaining **off-chain data**. 
The **on-line** storage may be extremely expensive and not recommended, except for:
- *information that must be persistenly recorded on-chain* (*digital art*)
- on-chain logic must interact with metadata (*e.g. age of Cryptokitties influence how kitty can breed*)
Differently, the **off-line** storage can be implemented in two different way: using a *Cloud provider* or using *IPFS -  InterPlanetary File System* that is a decentralized peer-to-peer network of computers around the world where data content is stored across multiple locations.
