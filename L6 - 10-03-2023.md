## Content Distribution Network (CDN)
A **Content Distribution Network (CDN)** is a distributed network of servers that are designed to deliver web content to end-users with high availability and performance. The CDN works by caching web content, such as images, videos, and static HTML pages, on servers located around the world. When a user requests a particular piece of content, the CDN will route the request to the nearest server that has a cached copy of the content, reducing latency and improving response time.

CDNs typically consist of three main components: **edge servers, a caching infrastructure, and a global network**. Edge servers are distributed geographically to bring the content as close to the end-users as possible. The caching infrastructure is used to store and manage the content, and the global network is responsible for routing traffic to the appropriate edge server.

As an example, let's consider a popular e-commerce website that sells products globally. The website's static content, such as images, product descriptions, and videos, can be cached on a CDN. When a user requests a product page, the CDN will route the request to the nearest edge server that has a cached copy of the page. This reduces the latency and improves the user experience. The CDN can also provide security features like DDoS protection and SSL/TLS encryption to improve website security.

Some popular CDN providers include Amazon CloudFront, Akamai, Cloudflare, and Fastly. These providers offer a wide range of features and configurations to meet the needs of various websites and applications.

# BitTorrent Protocol

BitTorrent is a **content distribution network**, not based entirely on P2P paradigm. The problem is how distribute the contents to hundres of thousends of simultaneous users.
The *efficient content distribution* is developed using **file swarming**, later discussed, which is based on the idea that *a peer makes whatever portion of the file that is downloaded immediately available for sharing*.
Some issues have to been addressed:
- Flash crowd phenomena: large number of request in small time period implies the ability to manage a high degree of unexpected traffic
- CDN (Content Delivery Network): data and services replication on different mirror servers to optimize bandwidth usage

The basic idea is to import the CDN mechanism in a P2P environment, without the intervention of a centralized server: differently from a P2P system, it does not perform all the functionsof a typical P2P system like *searching*. 

The initial file reques are served by a centralized server but further requests served by peers which have already received and replicated the files. 
The server distribute two further pieces: in parallel, so previous pieces are distributed. When all pieces are distributed among peers, the server is no more inolved in the file dsitribution. 
The distribution and recomposition on request of those piaces of file allows to avoid an unexpected and high load on a single node/server. 
![[Pasted image 20230311093749.png]]
In summary, more nodes can serve thc ontent, not only one server: there is the need to detect which node is currently providing the content by introducing the **tracker** that taking trace of who is currently providing the content. In the example, *JOE* connects to the tracker announcing the content he store and the tracker update the information *"JOE provide the content x"*. 
If *BOB* want to download the red content:
1. Open a connection ti the tracker and learn that *JOE* is providing the content
2. Establish a direct connection with *JOE*
3. *JOE* sends the content, from now on the distributon of the file goes on the directly between peers
4. *BOB* then announces the tracker that is can also provide the red content

### Glossary
- **Descriptor**: The file descriptor `.torrent` are managed by centralized server and not fully by the nodes. The descriptor includes the reference to a *tracker*.
- **Tracker**: entity which coordinates the peers sharing the file
- **Swarm**: set of peers collaborating to the distribution of the same file coordinate by the same tracker
- **Seeder**: peer which own all the parts of the file, having reconsturcted the entire content. At starting time a single seeder S exists
- **Leecher**: is a peer which has some part of no part of the file and downloads the file from the seeders and/or from other leechers.

## Protocol overview
![[Pasted image 20230311094220.png | 700]]

In the pictued schema, the **peer Seeder** is going to share a file by:
1. Upload the `.torrent` on a Torrent Server
2. Opens a connection to the **tracker** and informs it of iwn own existence:for the moment, it's the only peer which own the file
The **peer Peer** is going to download the file by:
3. Retrieve the *file description (`.torrent`)* and opens it through the BitTorrent client
4. Open a conenction to the tracker and informs it of itw own existence and recieve from the tracker a list of **peers of the swarm**
5. (and step `6`): opens a set of connections with other peers of the **Swarm** so ask other peer about the parts they own, declaring its interest in some part of the file. Continues by exchaing the information with the peers in the swarm.
If **Peer** remains online when it has finished the file download, it goes on distributing the file, so becoming a **Seeder**. 

Here a summarized schema on the process explained:
![[Pasted image 20230311094713.png]]

#toreview n.b: *chocking alg* to avoid free riding prob. (see later lectures)

### Pieces and suboieces (blocks)
The content is split into chucks called **pieces** of a choosen dimension between $256KB$ and $2MB$: later those pieces are divided into **blocks** of $16KB$. 
The hash of **each piece** in $SHA-1$ is stored in the `.torrent` file descriptor: pieces are the *smaller unit of retransmission* so when the pieces are retrieved from seeders, the hash in file descriptor and the computed one are compared to verify the correctness of the piece to determine if retransmission is needed.

## Publishing
Torrent publishing is a process of distributing large files over the internet using a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The process involves breaking the file into small pieces and distributing them to multiple users or peers. Each peer downloads and shares small pieces of the file with other peers, allowing for faster and more efficient downloading.

To publish a file on a torrent network, the following actions are typically taken:

1.  Create a Torrent File: The first step is to create a small metadata file known as a torrent file. The torrent file contains information about the file being distributed, such as its name, size, and checksums of each piece. It also contains a list of tracker servers that are used to coordinate the sharing of pieces between peers.
	![[Pasted image 20230311095142.png]]
    
2.  Upload the Torrent File: The torrent file is then uploaded to a torrent website or tracker server. The tracker server acts as a central coordinator between peers, keeping track of which peers have which pieces of the file.
    
3.  Share the Torrent File: Once the torrent file is uploaded, it can be shared with others through various means such as email, social media, or file sharing platforms. Peers can then download the torrent file and open it using a torrent client.
    
4.  Download the File: After opening the torrent file with a torrent client, the client connects to the tracker server and begins downloading the file by requesting pieces from other peers. As pieces are downloaded, the torrent client verifies their integrity using the checksums in the torrent file.
    
5.  Seed the File: Once the file has been fully downloaded, the torrent client can continue to upload or "seed" the file to other peers. This helps to improve the download speeds of other peers and contributes to the overall health of the torrent network.

The `.torrent` file descriptor are automatically generated by ad-hoc tools like *maketorrent* or by the BItTorrent client: some informations are required by the client like set-up info, address of a known tracker etc. To serialize the content it's used the **Bencode**: it's a serialization code similar to JSON but only used in `.torrent` files. The bencode serialization provide only 4 datatypes: `String, Integer, List, Dictionaries` and a set of simple rules, here listed:

1.  Strings: A string in Bencode is a sequence of bytes. It is encoded as follows: `<length>:<string>`. Here, `<length>` is the length of the string in bytes, and `<string>` is the actual string.

For example, the string "hello" would be encoded as `5:hello`.

2.  Integers: An integer in Bencode is a number encoded as follows: `i<integer>e`. Here, `<integer>` is the actual integer value.

For example, the integer 42 would be encoded as `i42e`.

3.  Lists: A list in Bencode is a collection of other Bencode data types, including strings, integers, lists, and dictionaries. It is encoded as follows: `l<item1><item2>...<itemN>e`. Here, `<item1>...<itemN>` are the individual items in the list.

For example, a list containing the integers 1, 2, and 3 would be encoded as `li1ei2ei3ee`.

4.  Dictionaries: A dictionary in Bencode is a collection of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be any Bencode data type. It is encoded as follows: `d<key1><value1>...<keyN><valueN>e`. Here, `<key1>...<keyN>` are the keys in the dictionary, and `<value1>...<valueN>` are their corresponding values.

For example, a dictionary containing the key "name" with the value "Alice" would be encoded as `d4:name5:Alicee`.


### Peer Bootstrap
In the boostrapping phase, a peer downloads the `.torrent` of the file it wants to download from the tracker: the peer retrieve the tracker's `URL` and connects to it by issuing an `HTTP GET` request. Then sends to the tracker the informationa bout its identity (*identifier, port, etc*), **the number of the peers of the swarm it needs** and other minor informations.

The **tracker** return a *random list* of **50 peers** already in the torrent, providing information for each peer like *peer ID, peer IP, peer Port*. 
**Tracker** are used for boostrap and as a **certification authority** but are not inolved in file distribution itself: if a `.torrent` file is certified by the server, there is no way to corrupt the torrent because each $SHA-1$ in the `.torrent` is used from peers to verify the integrity of the pieces received from the P2P Network.
A peer connects to some peers returned by the tracker open at most *40* outgoing connections so remaining peers keps as a pool of peers to connect if needed. 

A node uses only part of its bandwidth to boostrapping while another part is left free to accept incoming connections. 

#### Why blocks?: Pipelining
The idea to divide **pieces** into **blocks** derive from the fact that the BitTorrent protocol works on TCP Protocol so the underlying **Slow Start Mechanism** of TCP enter in action: if data are not regularly sent, TCP  brings the peers connection to a slower speed than normal. 
It's crucial to have always something to transfer on a given connection to sustain the transfer rate constant.
Each peer for each connection have always some blocks (*typically 5 blocks*) ready to sent for each connection.

The mechanism that allows to determine the order in which the pieces are selected is called **Peer Selection**: this mechanism is fundamental because an inefficient policy may end up in a situation where each peer has all identical set of easily avaiable pieces and none of the missing ones.
Several policies that provide efficiency exists:

#### 1. Strict Priority
![[Pasted image 20230311101310.png]]
if a subpiece of a piece has been required, all the other subpieces of the same piece are required before requiring another block. It favors a fast assemblage of the pieces: only the complete pieces may be exchanged with other peers so each peer tries to assemble in the fastest way complete pieces. 

#### 2. Rarest First
Each peer knows the pieces owned by the others so it have a **local view** (*by gossip algorithms*) of the **availability of each piece**: this allows to form the **Rarest Piece Set**  that contains the pieces with the *minimal availability*. 
The algorithm select a piece among the rarest, as pictured:
![[Pasted image 20230311101518.png | 600]]


![[Pasted image 20230311101953.png | 700]]
Imagine that there are a set of peers, the edges indicates the ownership of a piace: the pink piece is the rarest. So the upload rate is higher of the seed and because the pink piece is highly requested, in exchange everyone want to download from us so we can download faster from others. It's likely that the peers that own the rarest piace will be insweted in the upload list of several peers. 

One **advantage** is that it can increase download speeds because the more peers that hold a piece of the file, the faster the download. P2P networks can also prevent rarest piece missing, which can make it impossible to assemble the entire file if a seeder disconnects from the swarm. Additionally, using a P2P network can decrease pressure on the seeder because new downloaders can download parts of the file from other peers. This guarantees that the entire file is replicated and the download load on the seeder is decreased.


#### 3. Random First Piece
Initially, a lecher does not own any piece and cannot offer anything to the other peers of the swarm: it is important that a **peer acquires a piece as soon as possible, to start the negotiation** of the pieces with other peers (***unchoking algorithm***). 
In the *rarest first* politics is not initially exploited because the download of a rare peer may be slow the process, because:
1. less piece availability, larger request 
2. larger probability to choose a slow peer 
3. sharing of upload bandwidth of the owner of the rare piece

This introduces the *Random First Piece Policy* at least for the **first 4 pieces to download**: they are chosen at random. This allows a **fast starting** and, after that, the *rarest first policy* is exploited. 

#### 4. Endgame
The last piece is downloaded using the **Endgame** policy: in the final phase the peers are characterized by low bandwidth, slow down when transfer is going to end.

The key idea of this policy is that the last pieces of the file to download are required to **all the peers that own the file**: to avoid bandwidth waste, when the piece is received from the peer which has requested it, the download started in parallel are cancelled.
There is only a little waste of bandwidth, since the end game is executed for a small period of time.

![[Pasted image 20230311102701.png | 800]]

## Free riders problem
The *free riders* in a general definition are "*individuals hiding his/her preference for a common good, so avoiding to pay its price and giving to others the burden to pay the good*". So if there are other individuals interested in the common good, the free rider is aware that he/she can benefit of the common good without paying for it.

In BitTorrent, the *free riders* are **peers that do not put their bandwidth at disposal of the community**. The solution to this problem in P2P context is complex due to an absence of centralized entity that may control the nodes and it's not possible to impose a given behaviour to the BitTorrent clients, because it's possible to modify the of the client by reverse engineering. 
The used approach is to based on a *dynamic monitoring of the connection*: the **reprocity approach** states that *a client obtains a good service if and only if it gives a good service to the community*, implemented by ***Choking/Unchoking Algorithm***. 

### Choking Algorithm
Each peer, periodially, *evaluate its neighbour* 's download speed in the previous round and decides which neighbours it's going to *"choke"*. 
The decision on which peers to *unchock* is taken every 10 seconds by each peer ans it's based on:
1. The download rate of the last $X$ seconds
Because the use of TCP slow-start mechanism, rapidly choking and unchocking is bas thus the timeframe of 10 second is suitable to match the timeframe of the slow-start mechanism. 
If our upload rate is high more peers will allow us to download from them. This means that **we can get a higher download rate if we are a good uploader. This is the most important feature of the BitTorrent protocol**.

Here is a pictured scenario:
![[Pasted image 20230311103905.png]]

BitTorrent divides the time in **round** (*generally 10 seconds*): for each round, decides **to whom it wants to send data (upload)**. Each connection with a peer in the neighbor set is controlled by the following variables:
- `interested/uninterested`: want/do not want a piece from you? (download) 
- `chocked/unchocked`: want/do not want to send data to you? (upload)
The connections are **bidirectional** so each connection has associated a pair of the previous listed variables. 

Each peer maintains for each remote peer it is connected the following state:
- ***am_choking***: the local peer is choking the remote peer. it does not want to send data to the remote peer because the local peer is not satisfied about how this peer collaborates 
- ***am_interested***: the local peer is interested in at least one piece on the remote peer
- ***peer_choking***: the remote peer is choking the local peer.  The remote peer does not want to send data to the local peer, because it is not satisfied by the collaboration with the local peer
- ***peer_interested***: the remote peer is interested in at least one piece of the local peer

So the *local peer* can receive data from the *remoe peer* if:
1. the local peer is **interested** in the remote peer, and
2. the remote peer **unchoked** the local peer
![[Pasted image 20230311104352.png | 700]]

### Optimistic Unchoking
The previous algorithm does not take into account the newly entered peers because initially have nothing to trade and not obtain any interesting pieces. To overcome this limitation, BItTorrent adopt **optimistic unchoking**: one random selected peer is unchocked so the current download rate from that peer is ignoreted and allow newcomers to download resources.

## BitTorrent at a glance
![[Pasted image 20230311104808.png]]
Horizontal arrows represents the exchange of messages in P2P fashion (as discussed till now). 

### Two-way handshake
Once a TCP connection is established with one of the peer received by the tracker, a client perform a two-way handshake. The header of the message contains:
![[Pasted image 20230311105046.png]]

- name length:”0x13” 
- protocol name: “BitTorrent protocol” 
- “Reserved”: used to signal extensions to the basic protocol. \X00 if no extension 
- SHA-1: hash of the torrent file's infohash that contains the hash of the content the peer is looking for.
- peerID: the client random ID

The peer which receives a TCP connection request **may refuse the connection** based on two checks:
- if the hash does not correspond to **any hash of the files it is participating to download**. The tracker has returned the hash of each pieces so if the hash is not present, the connection is not allowed.
- if the ID of the peer does not correspond to those received by the tracker so the ID is not present in the *swarm* group (*returned by the tracker*,)
![[Pasted image 20230311105313.png | 600]]

### PEER WIRE PROTOCOL
Then, after the handshake, the first thing that peer exchange is the `<bitfield>`: it's a bitmask in which if bit $i$ is set to 1 the peer has the piece $i$, 0 otherwise. 
![[Pasted image 20230311105716.png | 700]]
The *message exchanged* are:
- **Interested**: sent from a peer A to another peer B.  It indicates that A is interested in any of the B’s pieces and contains the piece index. 
- **Unchoke /(Choke)**: sent from B to A if B unchokes A. It notifies that the request of download coming from A is accepted.
- **`Request<index, begin, length>`**: this message is sent from peer A to peer B to *request a subpiece (block)* with `<index>` index and starting with an offset `<begin>` within the piece, of length `<length>`. A requested can be sent **only after receiving Unchoke message from B**.
- **`Piece<index><begin><block>`**: only one message is used to *send pieces*. The message is sent from peer A to B to send a block to peer B: the block of index `<index>`, starting with offset begin within the piece and payload  `<block>`.  
- **Have**: notifies that a new piece is completely downloaded and is available for sharing.  It contains information useful for monitoring the swarm: who has what. When a peer receives a Have message, it updates its view of the swarm.
- **Not Interested** indicates that the sender is not interested in that piece anymore. May be sent after receiving a HAVE message
- **Cancel**: sent from a peer to another to indicate that it already got a piece and it is not interested in it anymore. It's sed in end game mode only: sent from peer A to peer B to cancel a request already sent to peer;  for the piece with index starting with an offset within the piece of a length.

## BitTorrent Mainline DHT

Bittorrent Mainline DHT allows to **decentralizes the tracker services** that usually represent the bottleneck. This allows to o provide a “trackerless” peer discovery mechanism to locate peers belonging to a swarm by asking to the DHT, instead of the tracker.

Each node of the DHT **stores a part of the tracker information**: now each peer implement two different functionalities:
1. a client/server listening on a TCP port that implements the BitTorrent wire protocol
2. a client/server listening on a UDP port implementing the distributed hash table protocol.
So the DHT plays the role of the tracker and **stores the content's infohash (*key*)** and **the list of the peers in the swarm (*value*)**. 

The protocol messages includes basic messages like:
- `PING`: probe a node’s availability or announce one's existence
- `GET_PEERS(H)`: look for peers belonging to the swarm for the content with InfoHash H. The contacted node may
	- store peers for H, replies with a PEER message containing them 
	- have no info for H: replies with the identifiers of the 8 peers closest to H
- `ANNOUNCE_PEER`:a peer announces it belongs to a swarm.
- `FIND_PEER (target_id)`: request for nodes which are close to the node with node ID target_id


### Example
![[Pasted image 20230311111416.png]]
For example Alice wants to download the piece of content stored by Bob and identified by id=14. Alice only knows the peers 6,7,13.
Following the [[Chord]] idea of contacting the clostest node (with XOR distance to the content as in [[Kademlia]]), the clostest to the result node is peer 13.
Now 13 does not known who has piece 14, so it sends back to Alice the clostest peer to it, being peer 15.
Peer 15 knows that peer 4 has the content, and sends the contact information to Alice, which can then use the BitTorrent TCP protocol to exchange the content with peer 4.

After downloading the piece, Alice sends(broadcasts) an **Announce** message to tell all the peers it stores piece 14 and can exchange it.

![[Pasted image 20230311111432.png]]
The announce message has key 14 and value (11(peerid),info=(ipaddr,port)).
All the other nodes will add it to their "tracker"informations.

The internet uses [[NAT]] to face the scarcity of IP address, this is a problem for Peer to Peer network.
