# Attacks: selfish mining and malleability
To discuss about attacks, we first describe the simplest scenario: *no blocks are mined at the same time* so no attacks are possible to be carried out. 
A new block `B` is mined by a miner: this block is shared by other nodes so when other nodes receives B, they add it to their blockchain. Every miner will start trying to mine a new block *on top of `B`*.
Another scenario is when we have to concurrent node, mined at the same time, that form a fork in the blockchain in *two directions*: both blocks are correct because are mined by following the protocol by trusted nodes. For this scenario, as discussed in [[L12 - 5-04-2023]], the solution is to use the **6 confirmation rule** or **Nakamoto rule**: all the transactions in the dead branch are not valid because are not recognized officially by all nodes as the longest and thus the valid chain.

This approach follows the **longest chain rule** that incentivize the miners to focus only on the longest chain. This implies to reorganize the chain: this lead to the possibility of *replacing blocks* that can be exploited for attacks.

Here an overview of attacks in *Bitcoin Network* with some countermeasures:

The malleability attack was based on an problem regarding the transaction algorithm that allows nodes to violate the trustness and modify the transaction information. 

### 1. Double Spending Attack
Basically, it tries to spend the *same bitcoin twice* by sending them to two different recipient at the same time. 

##### **Type 1**: 
First, simple strategy to carry out this type of attack is to send two transaction to the network: both transaction go in the *MemPool* of the miners so only one will be inserted in the next block from a *honest miner* while the second will be considered *invalid* because recognizes that the sender is trying to spend the same UTXO in two different transactions.

##### Type 2
The scenario get more complex if *those two transaction are validated by **different** miners*: this is the scenario where the blockchain forks, realizing the case already mentioned, solved by the *Nakamoto rule*.

##### Type 3
Another scenario is when the sender is also a **malicious miner** so he can validates a block and includes both transactions in the same block. Other nodes check the validity of the block and simply reject it: the attack does not succeed so mining effort is wasted.

##### Type 4
From the previous case, we can derivate another method: the sender is still a **malicious miner** and tries to perform a double spending attack by *"reversing"* the longest chain by **performing mining in stealth mode** so do not broadcast/propagate it's chain to the rest of the nodes immediately, delaying the propagation to the entire network.

##### Type 5
Another type of method involves using an *honest branch* mined by a *honest miner*: the sender is still an **untrusted miner** so in his *stealth blockchain* he exclude his own transaction (*that was in the green, legitimate branch*), inserting the *orange* blocks.

##### Type 6 (51% attack)
Another method is that the malicious sender creates a longer chain, broadcasting his version of the chain to the rest of the netwrok. It will be acceptd by the miners due to the **longest chain rule**: the malicious miner needs more hashing power than the rest of the miners, known as *51%* of the hashing power. So this allows to add blocks to his version of the blockchain faster and eventually build a longer chain.
![[Pasted image 20230417104836.png]]
As soon as the corrupted miner creates a longer blockchain, it ***suddenly broadcasts*** its blockchain to the rest of the network that must accepts the "*corrupted*" version of the blockchain as enforced by the **longest chain rule**. The chain is longer than the one they were working on and they switch to this chain.
If the attack succeeds,  the old chain is abandoned, and transaction in that chain are no more valid so the malicious sendr is able to spend again the same amount, already spended ion the abandoned branch.

An example of 51% attack was carried out by the mining group called *Ghash.io*. It came close to reaching 50% in 2014 but even with 50% this doesn't necessarily mean that it will perform an attack. The case of Ghash shows that is more remunerative to mining respect to perform an attack that lead to a price crash.

### Transaction Malleability Attack
It's based on the fact that you can modify the *transaction hash (**TXID**)* **without modifying** the signature of the transaction. It's noticeable to remember that the input of a transaction is signed by the private key of the owner. All the nodes receiving the transaction verify that the sender is really the owner of the transaction.
The transaction identifier `TXID` is the SHA-256 of all the fields in the transaction data: so it depends from the *unlocking script (signature script)* but a node can **change the unlocing script** in such a way that:
- the transaction has the same effect
- the signature is still valid
- the `TXID` **changes**
This implies that the signature is still valid despite the transaction ID changes.

Alice issues a BTC payment to Bob, and signs the transaction $TXID_{1}$: Bob alters Alice's transaction signature, before $TXID_{1}$ is confirmed, this results in a new transaction identifier, $TXID_{2}$, on the same content.
$TXID_{2}$ gets confirmed on the blockchain before $TXID_{1}$ so the latter will not be confirmed, because it appears as a double spending. Alice does not see her transaction confirmed amd Bob could then defraud Alice by asking her to issue a new payment. 
Alice belives this, because she see another transaction confirmed, not her transaction: a double spending attack performed by the receiver of the transaction allows Bob receives twice the intended amount.

The solution to avoid the **malleability attack** was to change the structure of bitcoin transaction data, kwnown as **Segregated Witness**.
The key idea was to separate all the malleable information into a separate *witness data* and compute the TXID without the *unlocking script* so the transaction identifier will never be able to change again. Here is pictured the process before the fork, called *SegWit*, and after:
![[Pasted image 20230412120506.png]]

### Denial of Service
As an example, imagine that a miner, say Alice, really dislikes some other user, say Bob, and want to denies service to him.
Alice decides that she will not include any transactions from Bob’s addresses in any block that she proposes for the block chain but if Bob’s transaction is not inserted into the next block that Alice proposes, it remains in the pool of *unconfirmed transactions* of all the miners 
Bob will just wait until that an honest node proposes a new block so his transaction will get into that block, so being confirmed by the network thus the block will be inserted in the blockchain.

## Bitcoin ecosystem
A bitcoin client can implement different features, based on its specific type:
- **Reference Ciient (Bitcoin Core)**:
- **Full Block Chain Node**: contains the full blockchain database and network routing but not partecipate to the mining of blocks.
- **Solo Miner**: contains mining function with a full copy of the blockchain and the bitcoin P2P network routing protocol.
- **Lightweight Wallet (SPV)**: contains a wallet and a network node on the bitcoin P2P protocol, without having the full blockchain. 

### Miners

Basically execute a continue HASH computation, with the core cycle composed by:
```bash
	while (1) 
		HDR[kNoncePos]++; 
		if (SHA256(SHA256(HDR)) < (65535 << 208)/ DIFFICULTY) 
			return;
```
Those activity lead to the design of specific hardware for mining, impliying an **increasing difficulty** over the year to be able to mine a new block. This was solved by Ethereum with PoS.

The first generation of mining was **CPU-based**: was based on the sequential search of right nonces or a few core parallization, compuitng  a SHA-256 directly in software, without specialzied hardware. 

The second generation was based on **GPUs** designed for high-performance graphics: this allowed to use an high degree of parallelism, computing different hashes with different nounces. This allowed the miners to achiee high throughput.
This approach lead to an under-use of GPU, consuming a lot of power. 

The hird generation was **FPGA-based**: they were programmed in Verilog and ensure performances as close as possible close to the custom hardware. This lead to design high performance GPUs, allowing excellent performance on *bitwise* operations. 

The fourth generation was based on **ASIC Application Specific Integrated Circuits**:  is an integrated circuit chip designed for a specific purpose. An ASIC miner is a computerized device that uses ASICs for the sole purpose of mining digital currency. Generally, each ASIC miner is constructed to mine a specific digital currency. So, a Bitcoin ASIC miner can mine only bitcoin. One way to think about bitcoin ASICs is as specialized bitcoin mining computers optimized to solve the mining algorithm by implementing a fast computation of *SHA-256*.

Two main approaches to mining:
- **Solo mining**: a single miner try to solve the computation problem. This scenario is described as a Poisson process
- **Mining pools**: miners group together to create **mining pools** that allows to reduce the variance of their income.

I the first case, the mining is a very risky task even if the reward is high: there is an high probability of spending a lot for mining hardware and electricity withouut obtainin a reward  for a long time. 
![[Pasted image 20230412121738.png]]

The bitcoin mining follows the Poisson distribution, having a large standard deviation.

For the second case, we have **mining pools** that ma operate in two different ways:
1. throuht a **centralized mining operator** so the miners should trust the pool manager
2. in a P2P way, using a private blockchain to manage the pool

For the **centralized** one, the pool manager send the blocks to all the miners, distributes revenues to members based on the work they have performed but the manager must be trusted by everyone. This implies also that nodes in the pool need to produce a measure of their work to be rewarded proportionally for his work, even if they are not able to solve the given problem and find the nounce.

![[Pasted image 20230412122342.png]]

This approach poses challenges like *how does the pool mananger known how much work the node of the pool are performing?*
The proposed solution is called **Mning shares**: it's a proof of the work done by a miner, sent to the mining pool cordinator. It's based on an hash called *near-valid blocks* or *near optimal hashes*: the hasesh contains fewer zeroes than those required by the current difficulty. This does not entirely shows that hard work have been done but probabilistically prove how much work has been done. 

#### Payout

In the **pay per share** model, the miner send to the mining pool operator the *partial solution* and receive a *reward* based on fair share of work executed and demonstrated.
The instant payout guarenteed to the miner presenting a share: this guarantees a reward without waiting for the pool to find a block but no bonus is paid to the miner who actually mines the block. The miners are payed from pool's existing balance so the risk is at the pool's operator but he is also protected by the participant fees.
The main disadvantages are that workers do not have valid incentives to send valid blocks to the manager so they can discard valid blocks but still be paid the same reward.

In the **pay proportional** model, the amount of payment depends on the whether or not the miner actually found a valid block. Every time a valid block is found, the rewards from that block are distributed to the members proprtional to how much work they actually did. 
This lower the risk for the pool manager because he payout only when a valid block is found.


### Decentralized mining pool
The key idea is that no operators is required to verify each miner's contribution to the pool: this is possible by building a **separate, private chain** that include also *"weak blocks"*, mined with lower difficulty. It's necessary to store in the private chain the transaction rewarding for mining weak blocks, until a valid block is found, then distribute the reawrd through a side blockchain which is then merged to the main chain, by a process kwnon as **merge mining**. 

So miners in the pool create a private blockchain, called **sharechain**: the difficulty of mining a block can be $n^{1} << n$ where $n^{1}$ is choosen such that a new block appears every 30 seconds. The block is built on top of the last block of the *public blockchain* so each block of the private blockchain correspond to a *share of work* done by one of the miners: this allows to avoid a central operator to check, by making the process transparent. 
![[Pasted image 20230417110834.png]]
The first block of the shared chain inclue the payment to `AAA`, the first miner generating a share. The second block includes a payment both to `AAA` and to `BBB`, the second miner solving the *reduced* ($n^{1} << n$) PoW. The process iterates. 
When a miner solves the PoW, the last block is linked to the "*real*" public blockchain so no miner can cheat avoiding to insert in the next blocks a payment all the payment to the previous ones.
This is the blockchain as seen by the rest of the network after a valid block is found in the mining pool:
