# Blockchain introduction

We'll introduce first basic concepts liike **ledgers, consensus in distributed environment, tamper freeness, proof of ownership, permissioned and permissionless blockchain**. 

A **blockchain**, as a general idea, is a *replicated ledger* on the nodes of the P2P network: it's consistent and immutable, despite the ledger can differs each other for a short period of time but they'll converge. The immutability derive from the nodes approvation, guaranteeing tamper freeness. 
Inside the blockchain there can be at most 3 types of data:
1. Hash of the current block
2. Hash of the previous block
3. Associated data within the current block
The data, in case of transactions, are realted to the source, destination and the amount. The two hash represent the chain, allowing chaining each block with the previous one. 
The **tamper freeness** guarantee that if changing one hash causing changing the hash of the following block but this does not imply to recompue some hashes, but it's necessary to find a value of the new hash that solves the Proof of Work.
This property is also guaranteed by the distributed consensus algorithm. 

### Ledger
A ledger store operations and mantains the order of operations. It have properties like:
1. *Append-only* list of event
2. *Tamper-proof*: inside an approved block is not possible to modify or remove a data. This guarantee also auditability.
3. *Consensus*: everyone agrees on the content
It can be used in each application that require a log of events. 

if the ledger is organized as a list of blocks it forms a blockchain but other topologies are possible like *graphs*. Assume as hypothesis that a block contain only a single operation (*not true for Eth or Btc*): the linearity of the structure and the consensus algorithm allows to avoid redundancy problems (*like the Double Spending probem*), ensuring that the  information stored are consistent each other. 

The **consensus** is the mechanism which defines:
1. who decies which operation will be added to the blockchain. This also implies select an *honest* node among the candidates.
2. which operation among those to be confirmed, will be added

The consus so represent an agreement on the same value: the nodes agree on one of the node's input and this proves the **validity** so, agree on someone's proposal. 
The **tamper freeness** is also guarantee through hash: computing the hash of each entry and storing in each entry the *predecessor's hash*. If one entry is *tampered*, there is thhe need to recompute the has of all the following one and this operation must be ***computationally hard*** so the hash of proof of work must be re-associated with the block. 

This poses several challenges, like:
- Mantain consistency in opresence of different network jitter, delay, eyc
- Some nodes can **cheat** so it's necessary to create bizantine parties (*see later for Bizantine Fault Tolerance*)
A classical result is that if the majority of the node is host the consensus algorithm works well: the definition of *majority* change with the protocol used.
As a **honest majority** we fer to the nodes which follows correctly the protocol by implementing and executing the consensus by voting: broadcast every operation on the network and collect all the votes.

The **double spending** problem is correlated to the consensus algorithm: the problem cannot be avoided totally and it depends on the notion of *"majority nodes"*.

#### Sybil attack
It consists in inject **multiple fake indetities** into the network: it's necessary to register with the DHT multiple times. 
This type of attack can have as a goal to control data replica, attack routing or disrupt network connectivity.
To guarantee that a single node cannot impersonates multiple logical identies some solutions are:
1. *Proof of Work*: require computational power, impling that the identity is not a single one
2. *Proof of Stake*: require stake
3. *Certified Node-IDs*: requires a central authority

Those methods poses a solution to define the majority in a context where everybody can easiily join the network and assume multiple identity. Using the **computing power controlled by each identity** allows to create multiple identities but are not usefull if in a single node/computer/controlled only by one subject. 

#### Proof of Work
As an example, the *Proof of work* is like a lottery to choose which node will decide the next block and the tickets are the production of proof of work by solving a complex computational problem. The nodes that win the lottery is paied when endorses validity and decies which is the next node of the blockchain. 

If two nodes "*win*" simultaneosly, so they have both the right to choose the next block this causes a **fork**: the two winner attach their new block to the blockchain, so those blocks are linked in parallel with the previous block. This scenario is infrequent but not impossible: it's solved when later winner decide which forks win, prouning the other. 

#### Proof of Ownership
In case of an *ICO - Initial Coin Offer* there is the necessity, after registering tokens on the blockchain, that the ownership of those tokens is tracked for each transaction executed on them. Because there is not centralized certification authority, a completely distributed solution is using **Asymmetric Key Cryptography**: generate the pair of key and anyiine who knows the private key matching the public key of Alice also owns the Alice tokens. 
The *public key identifies* the owner of the token publicly, the effective ownership is demonstrated by the propriety of the *private key* by signing the transfer operation. 
The transactions are registered on the ledge along with the signed transaction that can be verified by the receiver. 

### Blockchain access types
Two main type:
1. **Permissionless blockchain**: the property of a **permissionless blockchain** means that anyone can partecipate to the consensus of the blockchain, participating to the governance of the blockchain itself. Of course, in those type of blockchain, other operations are allowed like reading transactions etc. There is no central authority and the partecipation to the consensus is based on reward. 
2. **Permissioned blockchain**: the involves parties have identities (*human have password, sensors/automated nodes have keys*) and there is the guarantee to avoid the Sybil attack.

Based on the specific case of a supply chain, we can **restrict the access** to only the actors involved in the process of consensus: they can also be automated actors/nodes. An example is here pictured:

An interesting proposal is the **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance** consensus algorithm for small number of nodes.
