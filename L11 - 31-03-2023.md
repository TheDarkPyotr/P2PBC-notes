### Bitcoin scripts
Following the pictured example:
![[Pasted image 20230331141841.png]]
- `B` notifies its public key (*green key*) to A
- `A` sends its bitocin to the public key of B (*use public key is a semplification of the B's addresses*)
- `A` unlock some of its bitcoin that were locked by a previous transaction. He creates a lock on the bitcoin sent to B (*to the public key of B*)
- Only `B` will be able to unlock the received bitcoins using its *private key (red key)*
![[Pasted image 20230331141911.png]]
The script is executed in the *locking* and *unlocking phase*: referring the previous example, it's executed when the signature of `A` is verified in the transaction to trasnfer it to `B`.

![[Pasted image 20230331142136.png]]
The script complexity can change both in termsof key involved in the signing process and operations itself. 
The simplest example of script it **Pay to PubKey (P2PK)**: in this case, the locking script is inside the output of the transaction while the unlocking script is given as an input to the transaction. Let's describe an example that describe the script execution: 
![[Pasted image 20230331143056.png]]
The locking script is formed by `<Public Key> CHECKSIG`, while the unlocking script is only formed by the `<Signature>`. The execution of the CHECKSIG operation is executed by using the stack, taking the signature on the stack and veryfing that the actual owner have the rights to spend the given amount of BTC. 
Another type of script, the most used, it's known as **Pay To Public Key Hash (P2PKH)**: in this case, the locking script contain hash of the key, instead of the public key directly embedded into the script. 
The unlocking script must provide a public key which returns that hash of the address contained in the locking script and the signature corresponding to the public key. The script execution first hash the public key and compare to the hash in the locking script, chekcing if the signature is valid (*as in P2PK*).

#### Transaction Lifecycle
It starts with the transaction's creation, then the transaction is *signed* with one or more signatures idnicating the authorization to spend the fund referenced by the transaction. It's then broadcasted on the Bitcoin P2P Network and each network node (*partecipant*) validates and propagates the transaction until it reaches every node in the network. 
The transaction is verified by the miner nodes and included in a block of transaction, recorded on the blockchain. From that moment, the transaction is a permanent part of the blockchain: the fund llocated to a new owner by the transaction can then be spent in a new transaction, extending the chain of ownership. 

There is the pseudo-code to receive a transaction `t`:
```C
for each input (h, i) in t do 
	if output (h, i) is not in local UTXO or signature invalid 
		then Drop t and stop 
	end if 
end for 

if sum of values of inputs < sum of values of outputs then 
	Drop t and stop 
end if 

for each input (h, i) in t do 
	Remove (h, i) from local UTXO 
end for 

Append t to local memory pool (waiting for confirmation) 
Forward t to neighbors in the Bitcoin network
```

The algorithms does not contempalte the case for a 0 input transaction. 
All the nodes execute the previous algorithm when receiving a transaction, describing what is called as a **Local Acceptance Policy**: the transaction which are locally accepted by executing this algorithm ***may not be globally accepted*** so the transaction considered *unconfirmed* are added to a pool called the **Local Memory Pool** so when they will be added to the Bitcoin blockchain when they are globally confirmed. 
There are different local memory pools for different *unspent transaction output* in different nodes because of the **double spending problem**: this implies that the nodes will only guarantee ***eventual consistency*** by executing **Consensus Algorithms**:

## Distributed Consensus
It's a procedure to reach a *common agreement* in a distributed/decentralized environment with multi-agent system.
In a traditional distributed system there is a small number of nodes and fault tolerance is considered. The faulty nodes can crash or become unavailable. 
One of the most notable concepts is known as **Byzantine Fault**, referring to a node that start acting maliciously.
The **Nakamoto Consensus**, proposed initially for Bitcoin, was based on few principles:
- **Implicit approach to consensus**: there is no voting so there is an implicit agreement where the majority wins. There is no collective message passing alg. executed by the nodes.
- **Eventual consistency**: occasionally nodes see an incosistent view of the ledger but *eventually* everyone sees the same history of the ledger. In this scenario the main assumption is that majority of the nodes must be honest.

The proposed Nakamoto consensus works in practice but it's difficult to make a theoretical proof, in fact "*the mechanism through which Bitcoin achieves decentralization is not purely technical, but itâ€™s a combination of technical methods and ***clever incentive engineering***".

The **consensus algorithm** is necessary mainly to avoid the problem of **Double Spending**: if during the broadcasting of a transaction to all nodes another transaction occur, referring the same Bitcoin, it will be registered in the ledgers, realizing the double spending of the same amount.
Even try a rollback when a node recognizes the double spending, still remain the problem of two conflicting transaction on how determine which is valid and which one will be discarded. The described scenario shows the necessity to have a consensus algorithm.

In Bitcoin, every node mantains in RAM a *temporary memory* called **MemPool** that contains a collection of all Bitcoin ***transaction awaiting confirmation***. Those transaction wait until a consensus is reached and are included in the next ledger blocks. This pool is not an *UXTO* so they're not yet registered.
The *conficting transaction* may occur in MemPool and not in the ledger: whena  node receive a double spend, mark it as a conflicting transaction and discard it.
Of course some nodes can try to get the transaction out from the MemPool and put them onto the ledger: the final decision it's based on a **competition** between nodes. In case of **Nakamoto consensu**, the competition is implemented like a *lottery*: the process for cmpeting to add transaction from the MemPool to the ledger is called ***mining***. 
The winner adds the valid transaction from its MemPool to the ledger: broadcast the update version of its ledger to the neighbours by sending them the new added transaction that have been added.
The nodes that receives the new added transaction must ensure that no other transaction in its MemPool are conflicting, kicking out eventually conflictingone so MemPool is like a *clearing house* for transactions.

### Mining
The process consisting in adding a new block to the blockchain: a *network-wide competition* where every node in the network can work to try to add the next block to the blockchain. The mining process start with filling a **candidate block** witht ransaction taken from the memory pool: the node then construct a block header with a short summary of all the transaction in it and some metadata. Finally, the node perfoms the ***PoW - Proof of Work***.
![[Pasted image 20230331150840.png]]
Usually the transaction list is almost 1000x larger thhan the block header. The header contains:
- **version of the protocol**: used for bug fixing and new features
- **time**: local clock timestamp. It's used for tuning the difficulty of PoW. It indicates the time of block creation.
- **mhash**: it's the root of the ***Merkle tree*** built on the transaction. Te leaves of the tree are the block transactions. The merkle tree it's built on demand so it's not explicitly represented in the block. Any change to a transaction rresult in change of both the *mhash* and the hash of the whole block. Having the root of the Merkle tree allows to check the transaction integrity.
- **hashprev**: hash of the previous block, the block over which the miner build the current block. It's a SHA-256 field.
There are other two fields  called **target** and **nonce** that are realted to the POW (*see later*). 

The **mining process** works as follows: set the value of the nonc of the block header to 0, then compute the hash of the whole header and check if the resulting hash is under a certain threshold setted by the **target** field.
If the hash of the block header is not below the target, increment the **nonce** but mantains all other information equals to the previous: this allows to obtain a completely different hash. **Keep trying by incrementing the nonce until you find a value under the treshold.**

![[Pasted image 20230331151651.png]]
Here an example of unsuccessfull nonce values:

![[Pasted image 20230331151803.png]]
The difficulty of founding a suitable nonce can be tuned as well as different blocks may have different **target values**. The tuning is performed based on the number of nodes and the total computational power of all the nodes in the network.

### Random Node Selection
The selection of the nodes is randomly executed: the key idea is that the nodes are selected in proportion to a resource that it's hard to monopolize. In Bitcoin, this resource is the **computational power** and the selection is done on the basis of the Proof of Work.
![[Pasted image 20230331152559.png]]

The **Nakamoto consensus** works by selecting a leader node at random: the selection is implemented through the PoW and who is able to find the right nonce so to win the PoW, is seleted node and entitled to propose the next block. At least 51\% of the time, this process must pick an honest node.
The selected node *unilaterally proposes* without contacting other nodes, the next block to be inserted in the ledger: can be viewed as a random leader election on every block.
THe block is broadcasted in the network so all nodes cna check the validity and update their blockchains with the new chosen block.

#### Proof of Work - Formal definition
Let be:
- $d$: the difficulty as a positive nuber which is used to adjust the time to execute the proof
- $c$: the challenge as a given string (*the block header minus the nounce*)
- $x$: nonce as an unkwnon string
The proof of work is a function defined as $F_{d}(c,x) \rightarrow \{true,false\}$ that satisfy the following properties:
- $c,d$ are fixed
- $F_{d}(c,x)$ is fast to compute if all the three parameters are known
- Finding $x$ s.t. $F_{d}(c,x)=true$ is computationally difficult but feasible
The proof of work is **hard** to solve because the output looks like a random 256 bit string where each bit is equally likely to be 0 or 1, independently of the other bits. No better way of finding the correct output than trying **brute force**: the probability $p$ that the block hash falls below the target threshold $T$ is:
$p = \frac{T+1}{2^{256}}$
and the average numbers of trials required to find ablock hash below the treshold 1/p.

#### Mining reward
The mining activity is rewarded, incentivizing miners to be honest. Two main mechanism are implemented:
- **Block reward**: a payment to the miner in exchange for the service of creating a block. Bitcoins mints new coins whe a new block is mined. It's the only way to create new bitcoins.
- **Transaction fee**:for each transaction is the block, they take the difference between transaction input and output. It was voluntarly inserted to obtain a good quality of service from the miners. 

The **coinbase** is the first transaction in each block: it encodes the trasnfer of reward plus the transaction fees to the miner and does not consume previous unspent contained in the blockchain but uses a **single, dummy input** (*without reference to the previous transaction*) while the output is the sum of the rewards and fees that are given to the miner in one or more addresses.
The rewards dynamicaly varies in time: halve the mining reward after all 210.000 blocks (*every 4 year*). Each period is defined as *"era"*. 
Those rewards are the only way to generate new bitcoin: they exists in a limited supply in order of 21 millions.

Due to the arise of the miners and mining pool, it's not possible to compete nowadays with miners: they use specialized hardware.
