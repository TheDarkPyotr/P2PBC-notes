# Solidity
Differently from Ethereum, Bitcoin it's not considered when talking about smart contract because scripts are only to verify the spending of the token, not to support the full execution of user's code.

**Solidity** is a contract-oriented high level language for the *EVM*. It's a statically-typed, objected oriented language: *smart contracts* are similar to classes. The version of the compiler used it's defined by the `pragma` instruction. 
The overall lifecycle is:
1. Write code in high-level language
2. Compile to EVM bytecode
3. Deploy witha  transaction. The contract code is *read only*
4. Call function with a transaction

### Contract example
The purpose of this contract is to create tokens on top of Ethereum, as sort of "layer 2 crsoliypto": only the creator of the contract can mint new tokens and anyone who has an Ethereum account can exchange these tokens.

Differently from coin, **tokens** are uild on existing blockchain and are simpler to create because are implemented as smart contracts and leverage security and reputation of the existing blockchain on which are based.
#toreview 
```python
pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.9.0; 
contract Token { 
				address public minter; 
				mapping (address => uint) balances; #associates address to amount of toekn
		
		constructor() public { 
				minter = msg.sender; 
				}
	function mint(address owner, uint amount) public { require (msg.sender = minter); balances[owner] += amount; } function send(address receiver, uint amount) public { if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return; balances[msg.sender] -= amount; balances[receiver] += amount; } function queryBalance(address addr) public view returns (uint balance) { return balances[addr];} }
```
The `constructor()` is autoamtically invoked when the contract is firstly deployed
The type of ech variable is specified at compile time and most types can be *cast*, like `bool, unit8, int256, address, string, byte[], mapping(keyType => valueType)` where the lastone is similar to an hashmap.

#### `pragma` directive
The `pragma solidity` directive or *"version pragma"* defines the versions range of the compiler which can be used. This instructs the compiler to check whether its version matches the one required by the pragma: if does not match, the compiler issue an error. So it's used to reject compilation with future compiler version that might introduce **incompatible changes**. The caret `^` before the version number points in `pragma solidity >= 0.4.16 <0.9.0` out that not a compiler earlier version of 0.5.2 and not a compiler after 0.6.0. If no caret is specified all the versions newer than the ofe are referred as ok.

##### `address` type
The address is a $20$ byte value represented in hexademical prefixed with $0x$: it does not allows arithmetic operations and it's used to store address of contracts. Remember that, based on the account type:
- *Address for contract*. defined at the time of contract is created
- *Address of EOA*: hash of the public key of an EOA.
The `address` has several properties which can be queried, like the `address.balance` that contains the $wei$ of the address, or the `address.code` which contains the code of that address  (*that may also be empty*).
An address can also be assigned as `address owner = msg.sender` where the right variable is in the *global namespace* thus can be the address that sent the transaction containing the call to the function, either the EOA's address or another contract address.

### Data store model
Data in Solidity are of two types:
- **Storage**: variables stored permanently on the blockchain, stored in a Merkle Patricia trie of the block. It uses gas so must be avoided if not necessary.
- **Memory**: stored during function execution, used mainly for temporary variables and defined by the `memory` keyword.

The **storage** model is a sort of *huge array*, initially full of zeroes: each value in the array is $32$-bytes wide and there are $2^{256}$ such values so each state variable declared in teh smart contract will occupy a slot of **depending on its declaration postiion** and its type. 

The **memory** model, differently, is a sort of huge array initially full of *zeroes*: variable, structures and array are mapped to the location of this array so the storage is *sparsely populated* and zeros values **are not stored** (*thus an absent key is defined as a mapping to zero*).
*Static data* is stored contigously item after item with the first variable, which is stored in slot at position $0$, following according to the order or declaration. Thus for each variable, a size in $byte$
 is determine according to its type: multiple, contigous items that needs more than $32$ bytes are packedinto a single storage slot if possible. 
 As an example, the following snippet:
```python
contract example { 
				uint256 a; 
				unit256 [2] b; 
				struct exStruct { 
					uint256 name; 
					uint256 value;
				} 
				exStruct c; 
			}
```
Determine the following slot in the model at **compile time**:
![[Pasted image 20230424103001.png]]


Solidity also have **dynamic types** (*like dynamic arrays*): in this case, for the mapping, you have an empty slot associated with the map: the slot is computed using the `kekka256` hash function, thus the location is chosen at random without experiencing a collision (*there is no allocation and release step from a storage pool*).
After computing the hash of the slot, lay the elements of the dynamic arrayas for statically sized-arrays:
![[Pasted image 20230424103242.png]]
The position $5$ contains the length while the `kekka256(5)` contains the starting position of the elements.

Consider another example that involves a *dynamic hashmap `e`*:
```python
contract example { 
				uint256 a; 
				unit256 [2] b; 
				struct exStruct { 
					uint256 name; 
					uint256 value;
				} 
				exStruct c; 
				exstruct d[];
				mapping(uint256 => uint256) e;
			}
```
To avoid collisions we **concatenate** the key and the mapping slot, hashing the resulting value with `kekka256` (*SHA-3*).
concatenard with the position of the empty slot allows to retrieve  the associated value.
![[Pasted image 20230424103523.png]]
The empty slot indicates the starting point of the data structure: the position of the hashed items is obtained concatenating the hash of a given key with the empty slot position.
This is like use the entire 256-bit addressable memory space: when the `map` is declared is like that all the possible key exists and every key implicitly bound to all-zero value.
The key data is not stored in a mapping, only its hashed value is: the value is stored directly, without double indirection, pointers or linked lists thus the operations are guaranteed to be executed in $O(1)$.

### Constructors
Consider:
```python
contract Token{
			   address public minter;
			   mapping (address => uint) balances;
			   constructor() public {
				   minter = msg.sender;
				}
...
```
The  `constructor` function is invoked only when initially creating the contract and cannot be invoked afterwards. It's an optional function but if used must be declared with the `constructor` keyword in the new versions. The function is used for customization or setting the initial state of the contract.

The `msg` variable provides information contained in the transaction/message call that actioned the contract: those information are defined in the **global namespace** to provide the context on the transaction that has invoked a function.
The function signature is here examined:
![[Pasted image 20230424104409.png]]

There are two kinds of modifiers:
- **Visibility**: define who can **trigger the execution**, defining the behavior of the *caller*, like:
	- `external`: can be triggered by third parties via transacton or from other contracts. (*if `f` is external, `f()`  does not work while `this.f()` works*). This modifier is more efficient respect to `public` when receive large array of data.
	- `internal`: can be accessed by the current contracts and inheriting from it
	- `public`: without restrictions (*internal and external*)
	- `private`: accessible only from the contact where ae they are defined adn not by derived contracts
- **Mutability**: define who can access (*and modify*) the data, like:
	- `view` functions: cannot modify state or call other non-view functions
	- `pure` function: cannot read or modify the state, or call other non-pure functions

##### Error handling
Consider:
```python
function mint(address owner, uint amount) public { 
															require (msg.sender = minter); 
	balances[owner] += amount; 

}
```
Only the deploter of the contract can mint tokens: `require` tests conditions on function arguments or transaction fields, ensure condtions that cannot be detected until execution time. It throws an error and stop execution if some condition is not true: it's known as *state revert function* because undoes all the changes made in the current call. It consumes the gas up to the point of failure, refunding the remaining gas.

##### Event logging
Events are away for smart contracts written in Solidity to log that something has occurred: interested observers can watch for event and react accordingly: *events* are declared with the `event` jeyword and logged with `emit` keyword. They can also contains parameters.
```python
pragma solidity ^0.4.21; 
contract Counter { 
				  uint256 public count = 0; 
				  event Increment(address who); // declaring event 
				  function increment() public { 
				  emit Increment(msg.sender); // logging event 
				  count += 1; 
				  } 
		}
```
Events are an abstraction using the *logging* feature of the EVM: applications in the frontend can subscrube and listen for events as **callbacks**. The event logs are registered in the *transaction log*, a special data structure on the blockchain thus they can also be indexed and filtered.
Referring the token contract previously seen, consider to introduce the events in the token contract where the `emit` instruction emit an event each time tokens are transferred:

```python

pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.9.0
contract Token{
			   address public minter;
			   mapping(address => uint) balances;
			   event Sent(address from, address to, uint amount);
			function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
			if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return;
			balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
			balances[receiver]+=amount;
			emit Sent(msg.sender, receiver, amount);
			
			
			}
}
```


### Example: lottery on blockchain
The main problem is how obtain a *source of entropy* in a deterministic environment. A solution may be:
- *using external information*: this add complexity and external dependencies.
- *using blockchain data*: use the blockhas as a source of randomness but miners can perform an attack and change the timestamp of the block.
More complex solution we'll see involves using *RanDAO* or *VRF - Verifiable Random Functions* used in Algorand.
The solution here adopted involves using the blockhash to introduce randomization:
```python
pragma solidity ^0.8.0; 
contract SimpleLottery { 
						uint public constant TICKET_PRICE = 1 gwei; 
						address [] public players; 
						address payable public winner; 
						uint public ticketingCloses;
						constructor (uint duration) {
						 owner= msg.sender; 
						 ticketingCloses = block.timestamp + duration;
						 } 
						 function buy () public payable {
						  require(msg.value == TICKET_PRICE); 
						  require(block.timestamp < ticketingCloses); 
						  tickets.push(msg.sender); 
			}
		
```
The instruction `ticketingCloses = block.timestamp + duration;` takes the **current block timestamp** (*timestamp of block in which the transaction is validated*) returned as UNIX timestamp and add a duration to indicate for how long is possible to buy tickets.
The `require` functions are used to ensure that the condition are valid before execute the specific method actions: they usually refer to the *global namespace*. 
To access the *transaction properties* we can use:
- `msg.sender`: sender of the call/of the message (address) 
- `msg.value`: value sent in wei (`uint`) (*the investment in our case*) 
- `msg.gas`: gas unused after the execution of the transaction 
- `msg.data`:  complete calldata ($bytes$)
The methods to determine the winner and send the prize are:
```python
function drawWinner () public { 
	require(block.timestamp > ticketingCloses + 5 minutes); 
	require(winner == address(0)); //ensure no winner it still chosen, 0x0 as uninitialized address
	
	bytes32 bhash=blockhash(block.number-1); 
	bytes memory bytesArray = new bytes(32); 
	
	for (uint i; i <32; i++){
		bytesArray[i] =bhash[i];
		bytes32 rand=keccak256(bytesArray);
		winner = payable(tickets[uint(rand) % tickets.length]);
						}
			} 
function withdraw () public { 
		require(msg.sender == winner);
		 winner.transfer(address(this).balance);
		 } 
		fallback () payable external { buy(); } 
}
```

`address(0)` corresponds to the `NULL` value for the address data type.
To *flip a coin* in the contract we use `blockhash(block.number-1)`: thie ensure to have the same random value for each node that execute the contract. The function take the hash of the previous block, being determinstic. The computed value `bhash` is used as a form of seed for `keccak256` that compute the 256 hash function. 
The  `winner` variable contains the address of the winner, associated with the `payable` type that indicates that the transfer of the money in the balance of the smart contract must be directed to this address (*either EOA or another smart contract*). 

The **global variables** allows also to access to information about the specific block, using the variable `block` or accessing the transaction information using the `tx` variable. In a chain of transaction, this last variable, for example, is able to retrieve the information about the *origin transaction* that actiond the chain. Differently the `msg` global variable allows only to access the information about the last recent transaction that activated the executing function.

#### Sending and receiving ether
There are two main ways for sending Ether:
1. through transaction generated by EOAs
2. transferring Ether between smart contracts
This second method can lead to an attack called **DAO attack or reentrancy attack**: because your code may interact with a contract never seend, transferring Ether and executing third party code with an unknown behavior.
A solution to this scenario is to **limit the amount of gas** that a function execution can do: this allows to limit the number of action to be executed in a given smart contract. This forbid recursive call. 
This methods are implemented as:
- `address.trasnfer(value)`: allows gas limit on the execution of the function of the contract receiving funds (*2300 unit*). It throws an error if transfer fails and propagate the failure to the caller.
- `address.send(value)`: return `false` if trasnfer fails but does not throw excetion because the responsibility is delegated to the user to manage failures. The gas limit on the execution of the contract **receiving funds** is setted to `2300` unit and
- `(bool, success, ) = address.call{value: 10 ether, gas: 10000}("")`: this method allows to explicitly set the gas limit so if not specified it's not bounded to any value. It's a lower level function.
The $2300$ gas limit is arbitrary and can be insufficient for certain trusted operations that must be executed: a limit must be setted always to avoid certain type of recursive attacks.

The operation to **receive Ether** involves using a `fallback` function without an explicit name. 
```python
fallback () payable external {...} }
```
The `fallback` function is triggered when:
- another contract calls a function in the fallback's enclosing smart contract but the called function name does not mach or exists.
- if marked `payable`, a transaction payment is sent to the contract, without an explicit function call by the sender and no receive function is declared.
This function must be *externally called* thus cannot be called from inside the contract in which they are written. When a user sends money to the contract the fallback function is invoked. 
Respect to the previous lottery example, the `fallback` function is structured as:
```python
fallback () payable external {…..} }
function buy() public patable {
					require
					....
}
```

A *modifier function* allows to verify a given condition, even parametized, to condition the execution of a function and reuse the check in several different function execution.
