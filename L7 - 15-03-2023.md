# Cryptographic toolbox for DHT and Blockchains
The following tools are used for the development of DHT and blockchains: they include hash function, cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures. More advanced tools are accumulators and zero-knowledge principles. 

# Hash function
It's a function that convrts a binaty string of arbitrary length to a binary string of fixed length. The **input** is described by its length counted in bits, normally a maximum length but even zero length is permitted.
The **output** represent the compression and usually have a fixed length among 128-160-256-512 bit. 

There are noticeable differences among non-cryptographic and cryptographic one hashing function: in case of 8-bit block parity (*as shown in picture*), it's easy to find a collision by inverting any even numer of bits in $m$ that are in the same column and the parity will not change.

One of the main property desiderable from cryptographic hash function is the minimum probability to find a value that determine a collision. 

Another example is the **CRC - CyclIc Redundancy Check**: the CRC is the remainder in a long division calculation. In the past has been used to detect burst errors. 

The **hash collision** are inevitable since the codomain of the hasing function is smaller than the domain. It follows the **Pigeon Principle** for which if $n$ items are put into $m$ containrs, with $n \ge m$ then at least one container must contain more than one item. 
The **hash security** implies that it's very hard to *find* collisions because would require a huge amount of computational power. 
To bound the probability of having a collision, it's necessary to determine the maximum number of guesses to certainl find a collision by a brute force attack.

Using a brute force approach, picking $2^{256} + 1$ distinct values in the domain and compute the hashes of each of them, hecking if any two output are equal: for the pigeon principle at lest a collision will be founded.
The maximum number of guesses required is:
- $O(2^{n})$ time complexity
- O(1)
- n = len(H)

The birthday paradox show the correlation between the size of the domain and the maximum number of samples required: specific for the paradox, in a room with $n$ people, the value of $n$ to have the probability that two share a birthday becomes larger than $50\%$ under the hypothesis of:
- a year of 365 days
- all days equally probable
This result in the correlation of n = 23 ($\sqrt(365)$)


The paradox show a connection with hashing function H with $n$ possible outputs: there are $2^{n}$ possible different hashes.
If H is applied to k random inputs, what must be the value of k so that the prob. that at least a pair of $x,y$ satisfy $H(y) = H(x) = 0.5$?
If hashing about $2^{n/2}$ random values then you expect to find a collision because $\sqrt(2^{n}) = 2^{n/2}$ .

### Cryptographic hash functions
![[Pasted image 20230319105555.png]]
A *cryptographic* hash function is an hash function that minimize the **chance of collision** if the inputs are chosen at random: in case of an adversarial that look specifically to create a collision, it's necessary to guarantee a more robust property called ***adversarial collision resistance***, among other properties.

Must respect other property than non-cryptographic one:
1. **Adversarial collision resistance**: ensures that it is computationally infeasible for an attacker to find two distinct inputs that hash to the same output (i.e., a collision) even if the attacker can choose both inputs.
	*Let $H$ be a hash function with an $n$-bit output. Adversarial collision resistance can be enforced by ensuring that for any efficient adversary $A$, the probability that $A$ can find distinct inputs $x$ and $y$ such that $H(x) = H(y)$ is negligible, i.e.,

				$Pr[A(x,y) = 1] \leq \xi(n)$

where $\xi(n)$ is a negligible function of $n$, meaning that it approaches zero faster than any inverse polynomial in $n$ as $n$ grows.

2. **One-way function (Pre-image resistance)**: let $X$ be the domain and $Y$ the codomain of hash function $h$. For any $y \in Y$ it's hard to find $x \in X$ such that $h(x) = y$. Must be a one-way function.

3. **Collision resistace**: it's hard to find a pair of value $x_{1} \neq x_{2}$ such that $H(x_{1}) \neq H(x_{2})$.  
	![[Pasted image 20230319110056.png]]
4. **Second pre-image resistance**: given $M$ and thus $h=H(M)$ it's hard to find another value $M'$ that $H(M') = h$. This property is also kwnown as *wak collision resistance*

5. **Hiding**: (*see later*)
6. **Puzzle-friendliness**: (*see later*)


#### Attacking hash functions
The approaches followed for attacking an hash function:
- Cryptanalysis involves exploiting logical weaknesses in the algorithm
- Performing *brute force* attack: in cryptography it corresponds to an exhaustive search that might be used when it's not possible exploit other mechanism. 
The strenght of a hash function against brute force attacks depends on the lenfth of the hash code produced by the algorithm: for a hash code of length $n$, the level of effort is *proportional* to the following.
![[Pasted image 20230319110256.png]]
So given a $m$-bit hash function, the attacker needs $2^{\frac{m}{2}}$ brute force computation to find a collision: 
- MD5 is 128/2 = 64 bits security 
- SHA-1 is 160/2 = 80 bits security 
- SHA-256 is 256/2 = 128 bits security 
- SHA-512 is 512/2 = 256 bits security

### Hiding
To avoid that the attacker is able to guess the input domain, a solution is to pick a **random integer $R$** of 256 bits from a distribution with high min entropy (*no particular value is more likely then others*) and append $R$ to the original input. The input space becomes extremely hard to enumerate ($2^{257}$ possibilities).
The property can be defined formally as:
"*A hash function $H$ is said to be hiding if wehn a secret value R is chosen froma probability distribution that has **high min-entropy**  then given $H(R || x)$ 
it is infeasible to find $x$.".*
Referring the definition, $x$ is the **nounce** in Blockchain corresponding mechanism. 

## Commitment scheme (Hiding)
It allows to commit to a value and reveal it later: seal a value in an envelope and put that envelope out on the table where everyone can see it. 
![[Pasted image 20230315115544.png]]

An implementation of commitment scheme by using hash function, in an exchange scenario between Alice (*$A$*) and Bob (*$B$*), is the following:
1. $A \rightarrow B : h_{A} = H(RA || paper)$
2. $B \rightarrow A$: scissors
3. $A \rightarrow B: RA, paper$
At the end of the protocol Bob need to verify that the $h_{A}$ sent by Alice is equal to $H(RA || paper)$ so if the values agree Bob will known that Alice has not cheated. 
This scheme allows Bob to not determine priorly that ALice has committed to the value Paper because he does't known the random value $RA$ used (**Hiding property**) and he is unable to ivnert the hash function (**Pre-image resistance property**).  As soon as Bob sends the value scissors to ALice, she knowns she has lost but is unable to cheat: she would need to come up with a different value of $RA$, say $R0A$, which satisfies:
			$H(RA||paper) = H(R0A || stone)$
but this would mean that ALice could find collisions in the hash function: this will not happen if the hash function guarantee the **Second pre-image property**.

### Search Puzzles
An hash/search puzzle consists of:
-  a cryptographic hash function $H$ 
- a random value $r$ 
- a target set $S$ 
- a solution of the puzzle is a value $x$, such that $m =  r||x$, $H(m) \in S$. 
Based on ***partial pre-image attack***, you have to find a part of the input such that the output belongs to a set (*not a single value like in the pre-image attack*). 
![[Pasted image 20230319111651.png]]
The difficult of may be tuned by defining the size of the set $S$: if it's large, the puzzle is less difficult. For example, in Bitcoin, $m$ is defined by the number of leading zeroes of SHA-256. 

The **Puzzle-friendliness property** can be defined as: *"A hash function $H$ is said to be puzzle-friendly if:
	 For every possible $n$-bit output value $y$, if $k$ is chosen from a distribution with high min entropy then it's infeasible to find $x$ such thath $H(k||x) = y$ in time significantly less than $2^{n}$. 
"*
This property implies that **no solving strategy to solve a search puzzle is much better than trying exaustively all the values of x**. 

### Cryptographic hash applications
The peculiar class of hash function already defined allows to implement an **anti-tampering** property of the information by usin gthe hash value as the *checksum* to check if the data is changed or modified. To recognize if a content $C$ is the same of a contwent $C1$ that we saw before it's necessary to remember the hash of $C1$, compute the hash of $C$ and compare the two hashes so if they're equal, the content has not been tampered. 

This property is also embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain to store transaction ledger in a P2P Network:
