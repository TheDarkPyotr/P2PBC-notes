#### Mining difficult
The mining difficut it's **variable**: the frequency with which miners mine a new block depends on the computational power inside the overal network. The goal, fixed by Nakamoto, was to have a block mined *every 10 minutes*: this target it's not really fixed but it's adhusted by the protocol to acheive the goal. 
The goal depends also on the network condition to propagate the block to all/most of all nodes: the idea was to allows time to propagate across the whole network before the next blockg ets mined.  This allows to avoid incosistency between ledger's node (*differently from Eth that mines a block every 20s*).
The rationale behind the 10 minutes frequency is given by the followign example: if blocks are mined too frequently, iners can **build competing chains** but only one of this will become the longest so some miners will last energy building ona chain that will be left out.

The ideal scenario is represented by all miners concentrating the network's mining power on extending the same chain.
A shorter block time have advantages like *faster confirmation* and *less payout variance for miners* as Ethereum does by implementing more forks, introduction of **ommers** (*is a term used to refer to a type of block that is a direct descendant of the parent block, but was not included in the main blockchain*) and a more complex rewarding system.

To tune the difficulty, the target can be changed from one block to another: here two different target, with the longest sequence of 0's the more difficult target. Increase or decrease the number of starting zeros bits in the target, according to the ratio *expected time/actual time* allows to tune the difficulty. If blocks are mined faster than every 10 minutes, the target will adjust *downwards to make it more diificult to get below the target*.

Every node can determine the checkpoint of mining based on the time fields in each block: 2 weeks is an approximation of the time required to mine $2016$ block (*as $2016=14*24*6$*) that is the **number of blocks mined in two weeks if a block is found every 10 minutes**. Compute th ratio between the actual time between blocks and the expected amount of time and if it's < 1 it indicates that the mining of new blocks is too fast. This allows the nodes to understand if the *10 minutes goal* is satisfied or not.

Every nodes execute the same algorithms so they **adjust** the complexity in the same way as the other nodes: every node executes exactly the same algorithm so all nodes adopt the longest chain of blocks as their blockchain. They will end up calculating the same target as every node else thus all nodes end up sharing the same *current target* for the same block.

#### BTC Blockchain overview
The  **Bitcoin blockchain** consists of a liner list of blocks where each block is composed by *a block header* and a *list of transaction* structured as already seen: blocks are linked each other through **hash pointers**.

![[Pasted image 20230405120933.png]]
Blocks are **uniquely identified** by:
- ***Block hash***: it's computed when the block is received and not included in the block. It facilitate the block indexing and retrieval for future checks on transactions.
- ***Block height***: number of blocks proceding it in the blockchain, starting from the *genesis block*. 

The **tamper freeness** is guarantee by a combination of the *nonce* and the *hash pointers*. Image an attacker changing a transaction in a block: the **root of the Merkle tree** changes so also the block header change but this invalidates the *nonce* and the *PoW* must be re-executed to recompute the right *nonce* for the new block. 
In the next block, the *hash pointer* to the previous block changes as well because the *nonce* of the next block is no more valid and the ***PoW* has to be re-executed for the next block**.  This process is repeated for the entire chain so a potential attacker would have to recompute the PoW for the **entire chain**, using an enormous computing power.

A **block** represent the **unit of work for miners**: the base building block isn't a single transaction because, compared to blocks, those have a *shorter hash chain* that allows to fasten the verification process. Also, mining a single transaction would require more overall mining work and less efficient communication for transferring a single transaction instead of an entire block. 

#### Temporary forks
It's possible that at a given time, we have two miners *"winning at the same time"*: this is possible if two miners validate and broadcast a block simultaneously. This scenario result in a **fork** of the blockchain that now have two different branches. The state of the blockchain is seen by the network consists of two braces both originating from the same *parent block*: both branches are *legitimate* because are originated from the correct execution of mining algorithm by honest nodes.

This create the problem of **reconciliate the two versions** of the status of the blockchain:   in the Bitcoin blockchain, the applied solution is known as  ***Nakamoto rule*** in which "*the longest fork wins*". Basically, if a miner receives a block that makes the other fork longer, it *abandons the shorter fork*: the transactions of the abandoned fork that were not approved in the winning fork are return to the pool of *"not yet approved"* transactions.
This is the key idea behind the **6 confirmation rule**: Bitcoin approves a transaction finaly once there are **at least five following blocks in the chain**. So a transaction is not considered confirmed until at least 5 blocks follow it in the *longest fork*: 6 it's the default  value but can be choosen by the client itself. 
Here the skect of the algorithm:

The previous rules,combined with randomness introduced in the mining algorithm and block propagation **ensure that the probability to obtain two parallel chains of equal height is the lowest**. 

##### Nakamoto consensus
The theorem states that:
"*forks are eventually resolved and all nodes eventually agree on which is the longest blockchain. The system therefore guarantees eventual consistency.*"

The proof is here sketched:
- in order for the fork to continue to exist, **pairs of blocks need to be found in close succession**, extending distinct branches 
- otherwise the nodes on the shorter branch would switch to the longer one 
- the probability of branches being extended almost simultaneously **decreases exponentially with the length of the fork**
- hence there will eventually be a time when **only one branch is being extended**, becoming the longest branch.


The overall scenario is pictured here:
![[Pasted image 20230411110417.png]]
So instead of a blockchain, a **tree of blocks** is obtained: the path in the tree corresponding to the longest chain is the blockchain while dead path contains the **orphan blocks**.
