## P2P Overlays - Unstructured overlays

### Napster/Gnutella overview
The basic idea of *Napster* was to outsource the storage and exchange of files to the users so most of the service was provided by users themselves. Napster was avle to locate the usrs that can provide the file: the server was only an index of contents. 

In a simplified scenario, Napster was a P2P music file sharing with a centralized index server or *Master server* with several peers: a peer get the index of contents from the master server with the address/reference to all the peers which have the desired information. 
There were pros of this system like the **resource sharing** in which every node pays its pariticpation by providing access to its resources. Also some cons are corcerned with the **centralization point** that still exists and were represented by the master server, which is a single point of failure. 

**Gnutella** as Napster was a distributed, irregular network of peers without a central authority or server: the connections between the node define an **overlay network**. Peers establish **non transient direct (e.g. TCP connections) connection** between themselves: they broadcast a query throught the virtual connection of the overlay network.

As for Napster, the main pros was that there was no additional infrastructure, no administration and not a single point of failure but was an high network traffic with possibility of free riding. 

## Overlay Network
We define an overlay network as a *logical network* build on top of a physical network. Overlay links are **tunnels** through the underlying network: each logical link may correspond to a set of physical links and may transverse of a set of a router.

Two main types of overlay network and an hybrid type:

### P2P protocol overview
A P2P protocol defines a set of messages that the peers exchange, their formaed and semantics: it's usually defined onver the P2P overlay. 
All P2P protocols shares common charateristics, like: 
- Define a routing strategy at application level of stack TCP/IP stack
- Identification of the peer through **unique identifiers** which are usually computed by an hash function. Particular *cryptographic hashing function* allows to reduce the collision of uuid generated.
- Charaterizedby a hader and payload like packets at IP level

### Unstruncured overlays
In an **unstructured overlay network** peers are arbitrarly connected: the resulting overlay network is unstructured and make use of **look-up algorithms** by flooding the network with queries, expading the ring and use a random walk (*for example, see later*). There are pros like *easy to code/mantain*,*high resiliency* and some cons like **high lookup cost** that usually are linear in n (`n = #nodes`)  due to an absence of centralization autohirty (*like an index in Napster*) and **low scalability**. 
Some example of unstructured network are *Gnutella (v.04), BitTorrent (use DHT) and Bitcoin.*

#### Gnutella: a case of unstructured P2P overlay network
The basic idea is it that propagates the query to the network, flooding it: there was no index information used. The connection between peers are defined **at random**: the node that requested the content choose randomly the nodes that have the desired content. The established connection for transfering content is closed after finishing so it's transient, differently from the connections used to query the nodes that are **permanent**. 
Gnutella protocol includes some TTL, representing a constrained on the area of network the query is propagated, limiting the node reacheable from the source: this can cause false negative but it's not reacheable from the requester. 

Some general problem related to P2P network are, for example on **how to boostrap the network** or **how to find content without a central index**.
The first problem on bootstrapping can be solved as pictured:

The image show how a new joining peer can be boostrapped by a third component called **repository** that proivde the peer descriptors: query known DNS servers storing the IP address of a set of stable peers (which are always on the network). It's also widely used an **intenal cache** mechanism in which each client stores the IP address of peers contacted in the current and previous sessions: the cache can be dynamically update by gossiping with neighbour peers to drop addresses of nodes that exited the network. 

Let's deep dive into a **Network Discovery**  for an *unstructured P2P Network*. 

The **Network Discovery** follows those steps:
- **Step 0**: join the network
- **Step 1**: determine “who is on the network” by “ping” message to announce your presence on the network so other peers can respond with a “pong” message and also forward your “ping” to other already connected peers. A pong packet also contains info on the peer sending it, allowing two not-directly connected peers to communicate.
- **Step 2**: serching by sending a  ""*query*"  that asks other peer for some content: an example of a query packet “do you have any content that matches the string “*Back to Black*””?. By receiving the query peers check to see if they have matches and respond (if they have matches), otherwise send packet to connected peers if not to verify if other peers can answer the given query. 
- **Step3**: downloading when the desired resource is founded. The content transfer use **direct connections using HTTP's GET method**. 

The described steps are applied to the following scenario, pictured below:

in this schema the *TTL - Time To Live* is used to limit flooding.
