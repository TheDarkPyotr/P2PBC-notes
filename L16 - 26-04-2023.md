# Smart Contracts: Security Vulnerabilities

A ***DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization*** is an organization in whose management is decentralized and decision are autoamtized though smart contracts thus rules are encoded in a smart contract, removing the need for a central governing authority. The main goals of this type of organization is to reduce costs and provide more control and access to investors.

A *DAO* is a platform that allows everyone with a project to pitch their idea to the community for funding. Investors from around the world can send `ETHER` to a unique wallet in exchange for **DAO Tokens**: thosetokens give voting rights so the funds are pooled together. 
If a proposal passes a preliminary's curator checks, owner of a DA tokens can vote it, proportionally to their token: if a proposal is approved by a *quorum* of all tokens, the DAO automatically trasnfer *Ether* to the smart contract that represents the proposal. Finally, if the proposal increment the project value, stakeholders receive their rewards.

Basically a DAO is a *complex smart contract* with many features to reflect laws, respecting the stakeholder's rights, guaranteeing the right of a stakeholde rto require his shares to have back his funds when a prposal they do not want be a part of get approved despite their objection (*Appraisal right*).

### Simplified DAO
Imagine the following simplified scenario:
![[Pasted image 20230427075120.png]]
It's noticeable to highlight that the *wallet* contract does not use the function `send` or `trasnfer` to send *Ether*: it uses a previous Solidity version of the call function, named `call.value`, which does not specify any gas restriction. 
The `withdraw` method, the first time it's called, allows to transfer $10$ *Ether* from the wallet: if a second call is made, no transfer can happen because the `balance` is updated to $0$. 
This simple scenario allows to describe a set of vulnerabilities that lead to an attack in which the user contract can withdraw more than 10 *Ether*. 

#### 1. Re-entrancy vulnerability
A *re-entrancy* is a scenario in which an attacker performs **recursive withdrawals** to steal all *Ethers* locked in a contract. A procedure is *re-entrant* if its execution:
- can be *interrupted* in the middle
- *iniated over (re-entered)*
- both runs complete without errors
For a contract, a *non-recursive*, **re-entered** function allows the attacker to exploit the ***fallback/receive*** function to re-enter the function. The *atomicity* and sequentiality of transaction may induce programmers to believe that it cannot be re-entered. 
In general, *re-entrancy* may result in unexpected behavior and *loops of invocations* which eventually consume all the gas. 


The below code presents theÂ `InsecureEtherVault`Â contract, providing a simple vault allowing users to deposit their Ethers, transfer deposited Ethers to other users, withdraw all deposited Ethers, and check their balances.

![[Pasted image 20230427080137.png]]

As soon as the low-level functionÂ `call`Â is executed, a number of Ethers indicated by theÂ `balance`Â variable would be sent to the user wallet or external contract (Step 4). If an attackerâ€™sÂ `Attack`Â contract is the recipient, the contract can do the reentrancy by recursively calling theÂ `withdrawAll`Â function (Step 5) to drain out all Ethers locked in theÂ `InsecureEtherVault`Â contract. ðŸ˜¿  
  
The attack is effective here because theÂ `call`Â function is executed before updating the withdrawerâ€™s balance to 0 (i.e.,Â `userBalances[msg.sender] = 0`). Consequently, theÂ `Attack`Â contract can interrupt the control flow in the middle and execute the loop calls to theÂ `withdrawAll`Â function.Â **Since theÂ `withdrawAll`Â function would still retain the balance before the update, theÂ `Attack`Â contract can steal all Ethers.** (*See [Solidity Security By Example: Reentrancy](https://www.serial-coder.com/post/solidity-smart-contract-security-by-example-02-reentrancy/ for the full description and patching)*)

The solutions to the proposed attack method are:
- to use the functions `send()` or `transfer()` instead of `call.value()` (*in `InsecureEtherVault`*) or to **manually limit** the amount of gas passed to `call.value()`. This last method would not allow for recursive withdrawal calls due to the low gas stipend.
- to *update the user balancer prior to the transfer:* any recursive withdrawal call would attempt to trasnfer a balance of $0$ Ether.
A general rule is that if no *internal state updates* happen after an *Ether* trasnfer or an external function call inside a method then the method is **safe from the re-entrancy** vulnerability.

#### 2. Arithmetic over/under flow
Consider the following contract:
```python
pragma solidity ^0.8.0; 
contract Token { 
				mapping(address => uint) balances; 
				uint public totalSupply; 
				constructor (uint initialSupply) {
					 balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply = initialSupply; 
					} 
	function transfer(address to, uint value) public returns (bool) { 
		require(balances[msg.sender] - value >= 0);
		balances[msg.sender] -= balances[msg.sender] - value; 
		balances[to] = balances[to] + _value;
			return true; 
	} 
	function balanceOf (address owner) public view returns (uint balance) { 
		return balances[_owner];
		} 
}

```
In the previous code the `require(balances[msg.sender] - value >= 0);` check allows to verify that the `value` can be subtracted from the sender's `balance`, but still allows to perform the attack.
The *vulnerability* is created by an operation requiring a **fixed-size variable** to store a number that is outside th range of the variable's data type like:
```python
uint8 x = 0;
uint8 y = x - 1; //y is 255
```
In this case, the `uint` indicates an *unsigned integer of 8 bits, non negative number* thus subtracting $1$ from `x` results in an underflow that result in $255$. 
This scenario can be exploited in the `trasfer` function because if the attacker has a $0$ balance, the function is called with `_value` as a non-vero value that allows to obtain a positive value and thus pass the `require` check so thebalance will be updated with a positive number.
To avoid this scenario, it's better to not use the Solidity arithmetic operators directly but use third-party library like **SafeMath library**. 

#### 3. Front Running attack
Ethereum nodes pool transactions and form them into blocks: all the transactions are visible in the *Mempool* of a full node for a short period before they are executed (*thus inserted in a block by a miner*) so they can be *observed* by nodes to potentially perform an attack.
The **miner** who solves the block also chooses which transaction from the pool is elegible to enter the block: typicaly the order is given by the `gasPrice` of each transaction. The **attacker** can observe a transaction $T$ before it's commited ina  block so he can create a transaction $T_{i}$ of their own that pays a *higher gas price*, allowing $T_{i}$ to be executed before $T$: the order of the transaction can influence the final price payed when the transaction is executed thus it's possible that $T_{i}$ may indirectly alter the cost payed by the transaction $T$. 

Possible solutions to prevent this scenario are:
- *upper bound* on `gasPrice`: prevents users from getting preferential transaction ordering but does work if the **miners are also the attacker**.
- use a *commit-reveal scheme*:  transaction is sent with hidden information so after the transaction is included in the block, the user send another transaction revealing the data that was sent. 

#### 4. Transaction ordering attack
This type of attack is a **race condition attack**: if you purchase an item at a price advertised, you expect to pay that price.  This attack will *change the price during the processing of your transaction* because some one else (*the contract owner, miner or another user*) has **sent a transaction modifying the price before your transaction is complete**. 
Two transactions can be sent to the *mempool/tx-pool*, the order in which they arrive is irrelevant: the attacker could be a **miner**, as the miner can choose the order in which the transactions are mined, or may be a **node inserting a transaction with a higher fee**. A problem in Smart Contracts that rely on the state of storage variables to remain at certain value according to the order of transactions. Here an example:
```python
pragma solidity ^XXXXXX; 
contract TransactionOrdering { 
	uint256 price; 
	address owner; 
	event Purchase(address _buyer, uint256 _price); 
	event PriceChange(address _owner, uint256 _price);
	
	modifier ownerOnly() { 
		require(msg.sender == owner); 
		_; 
	} 
	constructor TransactionOrdering() { // constructor
		owner = msg.sender; 
		price = 100; 
	}
	function buy() returns (uint256) { 
		Purchase(msg.sender, price); 
		return price; 
	} 
	
	function setPrice(uint256 _price) ownerOnly { 
		price = _price; 
		PriceChange(owner, price); 
	} 
}
```
The *owner* of the contract deploy it with  `price = 100`: the buyer of digital asset call the `buy()` function to set a purchase at the price specified. The contract owner calls `setPrice()` and update the `price` storage value to $150$. The contract owner sends the transaction with aa *higher gas fees* so it's mined first, updarting the state of the contract due to the higher gas fee.
The buyers transaction gets mined soof after but not the `buy()` function will use the new update price of value $150$. 

#### 4. Miners attack

```python
pragma solidity ^0.8.0; 
contract Roulette { 
	uint public pastBlockTime; // forces one bet per block
	constructor() payable {} // initially fund contract 
	
	// fallback function used to make a bet 
	fallback () external payable { 
		// must send 10 ether to play 
		require(msg.value == 10 ether); 

		require(block.timestamp != pastBlockTime); 
		// only 1 transaction per block 
		pastBlockTime = block.timestamp; 
		if (block.timestamp % 15 == 0) { 
			// winner address 
			payable ap = payable(msg.sender);
			ap.transfer(address(this).balance); 
			} 
		} 
	}
```

It's like a *simple lottery*: one transaction per block can bet $10$ ether for a chance to win all the balance of the contract. The *basic assumptions* are:
- `block.timestamp` last two digits are *uniformely distributed*
- there would be a $1$ in $15$ chance of winning this lottery
The **miners attack** consists in the miners adjust the timestamp: they can choose a timestamp such that `block.timestamp` *modulo $15 = 0$*. In this way they may win both the *Ether locked in this contract* and the *block reward.* 

In practice, miners **cannot choose arbitrary timestamp**, they must be *monotonically increasing* thus block times cannot be set too far in the future. In any other case, the block will be rejected by the network. 

#### 5. Phishing attack
Generally speaking, a phishing attack consists in the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information like username, password, credit card details by appearing as a *trustworthy entity* in electronic communication.
A phishing attack in Solidity may be perfomed by exploiting the global variable `tx.origin` (*address of account that generated the transaction, the original external account*) instead of `msg.sender` (***immediate account**, external or contract that invokes the function*) :
- The attacker calls the target contract directlu thus his authorization is checked based on his *personal address*
- The attacker creates hiw own contract calling the target contract, runs a phising campaign to run the functionality on the attacker's contract.
- The attackers contract makes a transaction call to the target contract but the call originates from the user's address via `tx.origin`
- If the target contract processes the transaction via `msg.sender` the authorization check will be denied, forbidding to authorize the operation from the attacker
- If the target contract checks authorization via `tx.origin`, the attacker is accessing the target as the victims address thus ca bypass any authorization checks and simply process functionality as the victim user.
Here an example:

```python
pragma solidity ^0.8.0; 
contract Phishable { 
	address payable public owner; 
	constructor (address payable _owner) { 
		owner = _owner; 
	} 
	fallback() external payable {} // collect ether
	function withdrawAll(address payable recipient) public { 
		require (tx.origin == owner);
		recipient.transfer(address(this).balance); 
		} 
	}
	
import "Phishable.sol"; 
contract AttackContract {
	Phishable phishableContract; 
	address payable attacker; // The attacker's address to receive funds 
	constructor(Phishable phishableContract, address payable attackerAddress) { 
		phishableContract = phishableContract; 
		attacker = attackerAddress; 
	} 
	fallback () external payable {
		phishableContract.withdrawAll(attacker); 
		} 
	}
```

The **attacker**:
- deploys the `AttackContract` 
- convince the owner of the `Phishable` contract to send the *Attacker Contract* some amount of Ether 
- the `fallback` function is invoked 
- in turn, the `withdrawnAll` is invoked

The **victim**: 
- receives a call to `withdrawnAll` 
- the address that first initialised the call was the victim, that is the owner of the `Phishable` contract. 
- therefore, `tx.origin` will be equal to owner and the require of the `Phishable` contract will pass. 
- the victim sends all the funds to the attacker
