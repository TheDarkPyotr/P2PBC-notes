# Introduction
**Assessment**: final project with oral examination (questions on topics not covered by projects and discussion of projects). The release date of the project is supposed to be in May, 2023. 
New topic/project type this new: the introduction of cross-chain and syde-chain (*e.g. Polygon*). The standard project include develop a DApp or a Smart Contract over a blockchain or testnet. 

Two main parts of the course:
- *First part (mid march)*: basics (DHT and IPFS)
- *Second part (March to end)*: common data structure and mechanism in Bitcoin and Eth blockchain (*with introduction of Proof of Stake in ETH*). For each topic we will see *distributed algorithms, cyptography and probabilistic data structure*. 

### Detailed program

- **Overlay network**: allows to create a network abstraction at application level. There are two types:
	- **Unstructured overlays**: Flooding Random Walk, epidemic protocols
	- **Structured overlays**: DHT, Kademlia (*under the hood of BitTorrent, ETH P2P Network, IPFS*). 
- **IPFS (Interplanetary File System)**
- **Cryptographic and DS**: Bloom Filter, Merkle trees Merkle Patricia tries, cryptographic accumulators, Zero-Knowledge proofs (*ZK-Snarks: Zokrates*). 
- **Consensus Protocol**: Nakamoto Consensus Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Byzantine agreement, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance. 
- **Bitcoin**: Structure of transaction and blocks, consensus, double spending, P2P Network, wallet and weight clients, *pseudo-anonymity (fast introduction, no time)* . 
- **Ethereum**: differences to BTC, smart contract with Solidty (*gas, pitfails and hazards*). 
- **Blockchains scalability**: Lightning Network, cross-chain protocols

## Terminology
- **Non fungible token**: identify an unique asset, different from fungible token. 
- **Supply Chain**: 
- **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**: manage people's identity without intermediary institutions but only with a decentralized credential (no Certification Authority in the middle). 


## Paradigms evolutions
The client server paradigms is charaterized by the two component:
- **Client**: runs on end-host with an on/off behaviour. Is usually a service consumer that issues requests and do not communicate directly. Surely need to known the server IP address and never communicate each other. 
- **Server**: it's the service provider that receive requests and satisfy all clients requested.

### Peer-to-peer systems

Differently, in **peer to peer**, we have onyl a single component: the **Peer**
A **peer** runs on end-host, have a dynamic behaviour (enter/exit che network continously). The peer usually need to join a network: can be a problem because, differently from server, we don't have a fix static IP address to join or connect. We need to connect to a node already in the net: in the pictured scenario we indicate it as **S** (*Server*) that is used to **boostrap** the network. It's an entrypoin to the network of peers: following to the peer's joins the server can be "detacthed" or deleted. 
Peer needs also to discover each other: use a *gossip protocol* to discover and conenct two different peers: this allows the peers to provide and consume services each other, acting both as a provider and consumers based on each peer offered/requested service.
There is also the need to defines **communicaton rules** to prevent, for example, *free riding* (*the problem in which we provide a service without nothing in exchange*) and incentivate participation and reciprocation. 

As a first definition of P2P, we can state that:
"*A peer to peer system is a set of **autonomous entities** (peers) able to **auto-organize** and sharing a set of distributed resources in a computer network. The system exploits such resources to give a service in a **complete or partial decentralized way***"

The resources that can be **shared** are:
- Ledgers
- Storage Space (*e.g. Distributed File System*)
- **Computing power**
- **Bandwitdth**

A more refined definition of P2P is:
"*A P2P system is a distributed system defined by a set on nodes interconnected able to **auto-organize** and to build different topologies with the goal of **sharing resources** like CPU cycles, memory, bandwidth. The system is able to adapt to a **continous churn** of the nodes maintaining connectivity and reasonable performances without a centralized entity (like a server)*"

### History case: Napster
The download of the content was based on P2P but the index for search the content was centralized: the following evolutions that give birth to service like Gnutella, FastTrack, or BitTorrent have also search and content trasfer entirely completely distributed. 
So P2P cient acts like **servlet**: a peer behaves like a web server and the user that want to download a file behaves as a client. 

## Blockchain definitions

The **#1 definition** is:
	"*A shared database stored in multiple copies on computers throughout the world and is maintained without the need for a central authority (e.g. a bank, a government, Google, etc.)*"
	
Seems like a classical distributed database, which take to the **#2 definition**:
	"*replicated and consistent, **immutable**, append-only data storage system
	resistant to tampering*"

The **#3 definition** is the complete definition:

"*A write-only, decentralized, state machine that is maintained by untrusted
actors, secured by economic incentive in which the data cannot be deleted and cannot be shut down or censored. It supports defined operations agreed upon by participants that may not known each other and are **untrusted** but act in their best interect according to rules that incentivizes partecipation". 

The blockchain store the transaction: what is exactly the semantic of this transanction depends in the nature/purpose of the application. At high level, the **basics step of the blockchain process** are the following:

## Ethereum overview
Implement smart contracts based on protocols that use a blockckahin: they use a Turing-complete languages like  *Solidity* or *Serpent*. The smart contract is executed by all nodes as the consensus algorithm is used to obtain an agreement between every node of the network on the result of the computation. 

The **Ethereum blockchain** introduces smart contract that can be executed by blockchain's nodes: differently from Bitcoin where th script have only limited computational power, in Eth they can solve any computational problem (Turing-completeness). To avoid some sort of **Denial of Service** the concept of *gas fees* is used. 

## General taxonomy
Generally are distinguished along 2 axis: **Permissionless vs Permissioned** and **Public vs Private**, detailed here:
![[Pasted image 20230224142730.png]]
In this context, for *scalability* we means the number of transaction that can be confirmed/immutable registered in an unit of time. 


## Target scenarios for blockchains
Applications that required shared common, append-only database with limit capacity, based on specific necessity:

There are some advantages on using P2P, like exploiting computation resources in excess like idle CPU cycles to have in return other resources or service from network's nodes.
There is a shift of paradigms in blockchain that is concretely represented by its scientific challenges: the classic old metholodigies for the development of distributed system cannot be exploited in a context with million of nodes so classical alg/technique do not scale on networks of this size.
System dynamically and of those size needs new tools like *consensus algorithms, cryptographic distributed techniques, complex system analysis tools and strategier for the peer cooperation (Nash equilibrium).*

With **blockchain trilemma** we mean a big scientific challenge in which reside the optimal equilibrium between scalability, security and high level of decentralization. Those three properties are the desiredata from those systems but are not easy to gain because, for e.g., BTC is high security and high decentralized but it's low scalable.
