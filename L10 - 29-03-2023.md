# Transactions and scripts

Bitcoin is a ourely P2P version of digital cash without a controlling authority, no server and no banks as intermediary. It's also *permissionless*, thus without a regulator and *censorship resistant*, avoiding the frozen funds problem.
Initially was basically *free*, with neglectible transaction costs (*today the costs skyrocketed*) and *borderless* without geographic/national limits.

The proposed system allows *disintermediation* and  *pseudo-anonimity* because a transaction is performed without identity disclosures but still exists methods to discover the identity (*at least partially*) behind a transaction.

## Decentralized Identity Management
The identity is represented in a complete decentralized system as a cryptographic information, usually a *random key-pair values*:
- `sk`: private (secret) key
- `pk`: public key. Is the public *name* of a user, despite usually as a public name is used `Hash(pk)`
The pair allows only the owner of `sk` to control the identity: a transaction signed with a signature `sig` such that `verify(pk, data, sig) == true` so `pk` has generated the transaction because the `pk` is public and can be associated to a given user (*identified by `Hash(pk)`*).

The main cryptographic tool used in Bitcoin is *ECDSA - Elliptic Curve Signature Algorithm* (`secp256k1 curve`): it's used to sign transaction with the private key and to verify the signature of the transactions (*having the corrisponding publick key*). ECDSA is not a *post-quantum algorithm*. 
Bitcoin does not encrypt any information: keys are used only to prove the ownership of a given transaction that is public. 

##### Keys and addresses
The **privte key** `K` is a umber, usually picked at random: the ownership control over the private key is fundamental to control all fund associated with the corresponding BTC address.
From the private key `K`, it's possible generate the *public key* `Q` through elliptic curve *multiplication* operation (*a one-way function*). From `Q` is possible to generate the BTC address `A` using another one-way function.
The address generation follows:

Using the ***base 58*** implies that the number of char left with when using all the characters in the alphanumeric alphabet (62), byt remove all the easily mistakable characters, avoiding using `0,O,l,I` that can appear identical when displayed in certain fonts.
The advantages are that a large of character still remain and cna represent large numbers in a shorter format.

### Payment
The general workflow follows:
![[Pasted image 20230329120000.png]]
1. Bob shares its address `A` with Alice 
2. Alice generate a transaction  `t` which pays to `A` and broadcast `t` on the P2P network
3. Miners collects broadcasted transaction into a candidate block
4. Bob wait for confirmation on `t` before providing the good

Inside a single wallet there are several addresses: it contains a list of *private-public* key and for each pair it's associated an address. 
![[Pasted image 20230329120356.png]]
The output goes partially to Bob and partially is the *change*: usually is retuned to the same address or, to increase anonimity, is created another address associated within the Alice wallet to return the change.
All the input must be consumed, so input canot be splitted to let a change in the input address.
The *transaction fee* is $\sum{input} - \sum{output}$: the difference between the two represent the fee. The higher the fee the fastest the registration and validation protocol by the miners.

We can also have **multi-input transaction**: having several addresses in the wallet and having the need to aggregate the several amounts in different addresses to only one address.
![[Pasted image 20230329120856.png]]
Each input can also be owned by *different users*: the joint payment must be signed by all the  input's owners to produce and validate the transaction. 
This type of transaction is also susceptible to the **dustying attack** (*see later*).

Another type of payment is the **mono-input transaction** with one input and multiple output: it allows to distribute the value in input to multiple recipients.

Those transaction can be aggregated in multiple forms, like:

### Unspent TXransacton Output Model
The transaction model explained is called ***UTXO Model*** or **Unspent TXransacton Output Model**: the *unspent output addresses* are addresses that contains bitcoins that are not spent in any transaction. 
According to this model, each transaction input is linked to the output of the previous transaction: each transaction generate a new UXTO, which isincluded in the user's wallet and is available to spent. 
Each UXTO (*so it's no more an UXTO*) is spent if it's linked to the input of a the next transaction:
![[Pasted image 20230329121518.png]]
Usually only the last UTXO not spent is tracked to avoid to mantain in memory all the blockchain's blocks.
Each UXTO *locks* the newly generated UXTO to the new owner's public key: if the owner decides to use the UXTO in a new transaction, it must *unlock* the funds with the private key, signing the transaction. Who receive the transaction, became the owner of the unused UTXO. 
Another way to visualize the model is the following one:
![[Pasted image 20230329122837.png]]

The red circle cannot be used as transaction input, the green circle are the active addresses and new transaction can only use this as inputs. Only the unspent output are significative and mantained by the UXTO: to find the **balance of one address** is necessarily to sum the unspent UTXO of a given wallet, summing all the amounts in the different addresses in the same wallet, as pictured here:
![[Pasted image 20230331142342.png]]

The concept of a user’s bitcoin balance is a derived construct created by the wallet application: the wallet calculates the user’s balance by **scanning the blockchain and aggregating all UTXO belonging to that user** so an address balance is the sum of bitcoins in unspents outputs. 


### Scripts
It's contained inside a transaction: it's a simple program written in a simple programming lanaguage and it's **used to verify that the signature in the transaction** correspond to the public key. It allows to verify the ownership of the transferred coins: the code is executed by all the node of the blockchain, particularly the miners. 

Here is presented a real example. The following one is the **transaction header**:
![[Pasted image 20230329123352.png]]
The fields are:
- `hash`:  report the hash of all the information contained in the transaction itself. 
- `housekeeping`: to specify the protocol version, the fork, etc, allowing to use values in different way based on version. It also contains the size of input and output and the `lock_time` define the earliest time that a transaction can be added to the blockchain: if setted to 0 is immediately executed. 

The **transaction body** is composed by:
![[Pasted image 20230329123816.png]]
The `in` array is a JSON array in which each element contains a key-value pair where the key is the hash pointer to a previous transaction and index of the previous transaction's output to be spent. The `in` contains also the **unlocking script** as a *signature*.
The second JSON array is `out`: 
![[Pasted image 20230329124024.png]]
The JSON array contains a pair where the value is the value to be transferred in output and te **locking scripts** that contains the address (*the public key or its hash*) where that value has to be transferred.

##### Scripting language model
The Bitcoin scripts is based on a ***stack-based, non-Turing complete***: this avoid to create infinite loops to avoid that the nodes who validates the transaction can enter in a infinite loop, disrupting the network. 

It's **stateless** because there is no state prior to execution because all the information needed to execute are contained within the script.
It's also **determinsitic** so will predictably execute the same way on different system. 
It's a compact scripting language, consisting of one bytecode for the `OPCODE`, allowing a total of 256 instructions: basic arithmetic, basic logic (`IF...THEN...ELSE`), special purpose instructions to support cryptography (*hashes, signature verification, multisignature verification*).
So a script can be defined as *"a piece of code that verifies **a set of arbitrary conditions** that must be met in order to spend coins"*. There are several script types, from the most *simple signatures checks* that reedem a previous transaction signing it to the most complex like *MultiSig, proof-of-burn, Pay-to-Script-Hash, **escrow transactions, green addresses, micro payments**.*
